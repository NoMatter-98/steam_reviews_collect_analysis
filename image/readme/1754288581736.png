No microtransactions, no battle passes, no live services, and no BS. Just a single game with a solid amount of content, (mostly) fair difficulty challenges, a good amount of secrets to unlock, a serviceable story, and fun gameplay. It certainly helps that Journey to the West is one of my favorite stories. Blame Dragonball Z for getting me into it.     I only wish more games were like this.",527.0,2024-09-06 07:16:26,Recommended

0.9224016666412352,english,"[h1]Genre: Action-Adventure/Mythology[/h1]  This game is based on the novel Journey to the West. Sun Wukong is the main protagonist of that journey, and I would advise watching some summary before playing the game, to understand how insane he is and what he did. He was also an inspiration for Goku.   I didn't tag this game as Souls-like because I don't think it is. When you die, you don't lose ""souls"". Lore is way more detailed and not as hidden as in Souls games where you need to read item descriptions and listen to NPCs. Here most of the lore is found by just killing new enemies which unlock new entry in the journal. There are no stats like strength, dexterity etc. instead you have skill trees with so many things to upgrade. Also if you explore everything this game will be easier than Souls games most of the time. Black Myth: Wukong is the game on its own, the epic game for itself.  The first thing you can notice when you start this game is that in only a few seconds you are greeted by some colossal beings. I was amazed as soon as the game started, and the prologue itself is absolutely incredible. Slight spoiler, but in prologue you play as Sun Wukong, and after that game is divided into 6 chapters, where you are playing as Destined One years later trying to ""wake up"" Sun Wukong. Every time you kill a new enemy you will get some journal entry, which is a short story which has references to the Chinese folklore or Journey to the West, and reading these stories is necessary to understand the story. Sometimes I had to google, because the names were not explained. These stories are also usually very interesting, but there are so many of them so I would advise on reading them as soon as you get them, cause they can pile up. There are around 200 in total and some of them are connected where story continues from one entry to another.  The story itself is pretty interesting, and there are a lot of amazing cutscenes. Each of the first 5 chapters features a new story set in some new world. Each of these chapters has some main ""villain"" that you need to beat to get the rune.  When I first started playing this game, after overwhelming prologue, chapter 1 felt a bit rushed and kinda underwhelming, because if you don't read those journal entries the whole chapter will feel like the boss rush, but after some time I started liking it. Chapter 2 is definitely way bigger and opens way more, however it's a big desert, so it can get tiring. Chapter 3 is where things got very interesting and very confusing, because it is so big, and it branches so much. At first it felt okay, but then I reached a big forest with snow everywhere, and everything looked similar, you could go anywhere, like in 15 directions. Thankfully with those journal entries you can see if you missed something. And when I was done with this forest there was some temple area, which as well was really really big, and had so much going on, that the whole chapter was very confusing, even though it was very interesting story-wise. It is also the longest chapter in the game. Chapter 4 is also very long and it is probably one of the best when it comes to story, but it is a bit gloomy. Chapter 5 was kinda short, and it was mostly fighting bosses, but it was as well a pretty interesting chapter with interesting story line. Chapter 6 is very different from all other chapters, you are just going around and searching for some bosses, trying to find some items before fighting the final boss.  The first 5 chapters also feature secret areas which I would advise beating, since most of the time they will make the end boss of the chapter much easier with some new item that you got, and they are also very interesting. The game also features 2 endings, and to get true ending you will need to beat all these secret areas.  Throughout the game there are so many bosses and mini-bosses to beat, I think I have beaten over 100 of them, but I definitely beat them all since I got all journal entries in the game. Most of these bosses took me few tries most, and a lot of them can actually be considered mini-bosses, and those mini-bosses sometimes leave spirits which you can collect and summon later while fighting. It can be a bit overwhelming to fight bosses all the time, but eventually I got used to it, and since I mostly beat them all on first or second try, it felt like fighting regular enemies eventually. The problem with fighting so many bosses is that rarely any boss will be memorable. If you explore everything and you are ""good"" at Souls games you will not have problems with this game. Only one boss in this game which is necessary to beat to get true ending took me a lot of tries, I think I needed a few hours. Boss is so epic and hard, and in my personal experience it's 2nd hardest boss from all bosses I've ever fought including all Souls games.  Combat is just incredible, it's so fun, one of the best I have seen. Destined One is wielding staff so fast, and he is so fast that you can just dodge anything and you need to dodge all the time. You also need to make the best use of spells that you get through the game. One spell will let you freeze the enemy for few seconds. One spell will make duplicates of you for few seconds which help you fight. I mentioned already that you will be able to call spirits, and you will also be able to transform. Transformations regenerate over time, as well as spirits (when you fight you get KI which regenerates spirits), but spells cost mana, and until you rest again at shrine you will not get mana back, so prepare to become good with your staff. Overall combat is just amazing, incredibly fun.  In addition to combat, there are shrines on which you can rest, fast travel etc., and while fighting you earn skill points which you can use to upgrade your abilities. You can also restart these abilities at any point on any shrine. You can travel from chapter to chapter at any point in the story. You can also craft armor and staff that you get from fighting bosses, and use some items to help you make game easier.  Game took me around ~65h to beat all bosses, get all journal entries and get most of the achievements. You can't get all achievements in the first run, so you must play ng+ for the rest of them, however ng+ is pretty easy. Only problem is that some achievements require farming. There aren't many NPCs side quests, but there a lot of characters. Performance wise a lot of people complain, and I also had issues which I fixed by using FSR instead of DLSS and frame generation on. I managed to get my game running completelly smooth, stutter free, but I had insane stutter at first.  [h1]Pros:[/h1] - One of the best openings in the games I've ever seen - Incredibly fun combat - Journal entries are so interesting - Cutscenes are amazing - Most bosses are unique, and there are many good bosses - Pretty good story and everything about Sun Wukong is so interesting  [h1]Neutral:[/h1] - Chapter 3 can be a bit confusing to explore, it can feel like it's easy to miss stuff, but it's also really interesting  [h1]Cons:[/h1] - Chapter 6 introduces new ability, but it also feels so random, just searching for bosses  [h1]Verdict:[/h1] Just an incredible game, my personal GOTY of the 2024 so far, and of the best and most fun games I've ever played. I liked it so much that I ordered The Journey to the West books and this is definitely one of my new favorite games.

0.8915289044380187,english,"[h1]Sensational experience[/h1] Black Myth: Wukong was released under a lot of anticipation after gameplay showcases had been shown over the past few years, leading people to even question if the game would really come out like that. Thankfully, it really did – and overcame all expectations. The game is engaging, well made, fluid, has a fair dose of difficulty, is downright beautiful and is worth every penny and time you put into it.  [h1]Story background[/h1] I honestly find it hard to catch up with the story – at least without any knowledge on the classical Chinese novel The Journey To The West, where the developers have taken inspiration from. Still, that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy the game, especially during a second playthrough.  The game isn’t the classical novel itself, but inspired by it. It’s set after Sun Wukong’s disappearance/death after his fight against the Celestial Court – event that serves as a prologue. You play as a monkey warrior referred to as The Destined One, who journeys through the land to recover Sun Wukong’s six relics, which were scattered across the land, in order to try to bring the famous monkey back to life.  [h1]How does it feel?[/h1] It feels amazing! Black Myth: Wukong is a third person game that you can label under the soulslike banner. However, that doesn’t mean it has an excruciating difficulty. It’s more of a friendly soulslike with some elements of hack and slash – enemies are usually difficult, bosses are challenging, but you won’t lose anything if you die. It might take you some time to beat some bosses, but you eventually end up succeeding. The more you venture into the game, the better you get because you are earned more resources to fight, as well as you get naturally better at playing it. There practically aren’t hordes of enemies like in a hack and slash game, so you won’t be swarmed.  A magical iron staff is your main weapon, but there are also magical skills, transformations, three difference stances, potions to temporarily enhance your abilities and a skill tree to spend your points on according to your playstyle. There won’t be enough points (sparks) to buy all abilities, so be wise and understand what your playstyle is and don’t waste sparks on things you don’t use – although it’s possible to reattribute them.  Among the things that make this game appealing is the fluid combat. It’s not sluggish, floaty and clunky as most soulslike games. The movements are beautiful and fast-paced, satisfying to perform. And the bosses hardly ever have the same movements. They are pretty much all unique, which adds to the game. So you don’t feel you are facing a repetition of a previous boss under new skin, except for the elemental frogs.  [h1]Graphics and details are no joke[/h1] Black Myth: Wukong is a ‘new’ generation game like no other. It features the best and most advanced technologies out there, and applies them very well. It’s not a poorly optimized game – it indeed is a heavy one. But even if you lower the presets, you are still going to have a beautiful game.  The game doesn’t survive on good graphics alone. I could say it’s absolutely one of the most beautiful games I’ve ever played. The details in the scenarios, the architecture, the clothes, the weapons, with all the rich Chinese ornamentations… how well detailed the enemies are when it comes to appearance, movements, attacks… how varied everything is… You can spend a lot of time just gazing at details, which contributes a lot to your immersion. Well, I could spend all day long listing how incredible the details are. Game Science didn’t have any laziness.  [h1]Flaws[/h1] Of course, there are flaws. The game is so incredible to the point that the flaws aren’t a deal breaker, but they’re so silly they shouldn’t be there.  The most alarming of all are the invisible walls. Wukong is full of them, even at unnecessary places! We’re not talking about a totally linear game – there are areas of (semi) open world. It means there shouldn’t be invisible walls, even inside monk temples where you could walk to the temple wall. But you can’t because there’s another invisible wall before it. When it happens, it breaks the immersion a little bit.  Another grave one is the simply terrible lip sync. That disturbs our enjoyment a lot if we pay attention to it rather than notice other graphical elements. That's why I stopped looking at their mouths and began admiring the rest. They haven't used any AI to lip sync with English, so the English voiceover doesn't match the Chinese lip movements. Embarrassing.  Also, some lighting issues sometimes occur. When you walk into a new area, for instance, you may experience light sources changing, just popping from dark to clear sunlight all of a sudden, like inside some caves or other places in the desert.  I’ve also experienced enemies, NPCs and other elements popping in front of me in the scenarios, less frequently though. Maybe it could have been due to hours of session straight.  At least three or four times, I was forced to close the game and rerun it after some lags and huge fps drops – also after long hours of gameplay straight. You see, I got 32GB RAM, but maybe the game uses it so much that the memories are unable to erase unnecessary information. But, rerunning the game always fixed it.  [h1]Black Myth: Wukong is a must[/h1] It’s not any game that has some flaws yet its strengths eclipse them. The flaws don’t ruin your experience, and you definitely should play this game. Wukong is one of those games you can’t miss and will make you have an unforgettable experience.  Black Myth: Wukong is not groundbreaking, it doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but proves that if devs really want to create a game with competence and passion – and above all, a game that is supposed to be what it is: a videogame! –, they deliver wonderful experiences.  The price tag is fair for such a masterpiece. You don’t need to wait for sales. Grab it!",5954.0,2024-09-05 01:11:24,Recommended

0.8485687375068665,english,"[h1] Blooming proudly in the barren desert of AAA titles [/h1]   [h2] 8.5/10 [/h2]  [h3] Opening [/h3]  For a long time, whenever talking about China's game industry, it seems that countless players have sighed and lamented. Though its market value is tremendous and cannot be underestimated, the entire industry is almost supported by online and mobile games, and there are few achievements in AAA single-player games. In this context, August 20, 2024, would definitely be an unforgettable day for Chinese gamers. The future of Chinese single-player games, Black Myth: Wukong, has officially been released. On its first day, it has already reached a stunning 2.2 million players, and as of today, its total sales have reached 18 million copies, not only did it set a new first-week sales record among its genre, but also became the single-player game with the highest peak player count on steam. As the Chinese saying goes, 'A big tree attracts the wind'. While Black Myth: Wukong has won a large number of fans, it has also faced widespread questions and criticism. Can the quality of this game live up to such outstanding sales and an incredible number of players?  [h3] Strength [/h3]  Overall, Black Myth: Wukong is a work whose merits outweigh its flaws. Though its strengths and weaknesses are clear, we cannot dismiss it completely because of this. Games featuring traditional Chinese landscapes, realistic cultural scenes such as Buddha statues and temples, and Chinese Taoist Mythology are rare nowadays. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, this game showcases a level of visual refinement and scene interactivity that is beyond the reach of most previous AAA titles, the realistic and delicate scene interaction brings players an immersive gaming experience, and the stunning art is enough to allow players to indulge in this gorgeous world where every screenshot feels like wallpaper. The game and combat in each chapter are unique and thrilling, the amazing music adds an immersive atmosphere to it, too. The movie-quality cutscenes are of extremely high standards in terms of camera movement and performance effects. The ending animations of each chapter, which are in different styles, are well-made and profound in connotation.   Though the plot narrative technique is rather obscure and difficult to grasp, the in-game journal fully supplements the worldview, characters, and background in the form of fables or stories. Reading thoroughly will allow you to unravel the plot's complex themes. Countless talents and a wide range of spells for players to freely choose from, thus evolving into numerous genres of gameplay. The game's transformation mechanism is a major feature, combined with the character's flexible body movements and gorgeous battle performance effects, Black Myth: Wukong remains consistently entertaining and engaging in each battle. The final boss and the final hidden boss battles have put a lot of effort into the design of the mechanism, the battle scene, and the artistic conception conveyed. The upgradable that can freely reset and no death penalty have all greatly optimized the player's gaming experience, most players will not find the game overly difficult to complete.  [h3] Weakness [/h3]  Whether in good or bad ways, this game draws heavily on the design of many souls-like games. Even though the plot of Black Myth: Wukong is extremely profound, the overly fragmented storytelling hinders player comprehension. The plot based on the conclusion of the Journey to the West, is very familiar to Chinese players, however, the lack of clear cause-and-effect explanations will likely confuse many others. The journal also contains a vast amount of text, not all players may have the patience to finish it, let alone delve into the original Journey to the West. While the Chinese voice acting is excellent, the English voice acting feels a little lackluster, and misplaced and missing subtitles also show that Black Myth: Wukong still needs to improve in terms of localization. The developer may aim to encourage players to get rid of guides and explore on their own, but in a vast world with interconnected routes, extremely low scene recognition, and high similarity, without route guides and in-game maps, it is very easy to lose your sense of direction when actually playing. The frequent appearance of invisible walls since the third chapter makes it even more difficult for players to judge the true boundaries of the map. Player would find it hard to experience the complete game content without a guide.   The numerous skills and transformations vary significantly in strength, the character's fragile ability to withstand attacks also makes the game have relatively high requirements on the player's reaction ability and operational tolerance. The optimization of Black Myth: Wukong is extremely poor, with problems such as long loading time, frame drops, and crashes often occurring. In terms of the lighting transition between light and dark scenes, and the lighting effects in dark scenes, Black Myth: Wukong also performs extremely poorly. The design of the large bosses in the game, such as Captain wise-voice and The duskveil is problematic, the battle experience is frustrating. The design of the probability of dropping some collectibles is even worse, and compared to the earliest gameplay trailer, the officially released version has cut too much content. Even in the existing chapters, many story elements feel abrupt and lack depth, leaving too many gaps. Although the fifth and sixth chapters are also quite good, they are inferior to the previous chapters, and signs of development rush are extremely obvious.   [h3] Conclusion [/h3]  In a market lacking AAA titles, Game Science has made unremitting efforts and delivered Black Myth: Wukong in 4 years, which is no small feat. Whether through its unique, realistic, and excellent art, or its satisfying and exhilarating comfort, it will definitely make you indulge in it. If you take the time and savor it quietly, you will definitely be shocked and leave endless aftertaste. It should be noted that no matter how good a game is, it will eventually have its audience, and this is especially true for Black Myth: Wukong as an action role-playing game. As the saying goes, 'seeing is believing.' if you can accept the shortcomings mentioned above, you still need to experience it for yourself to understand its mystery.   In the end, Black Myth: Wukong still benefits the vast majority of players on three major levels: in terms of game aesthetics, its success stands in stark contrast to the dismal ending of Concord, which implements political correctness and diversified aesthetics, and will inevitably sound the alarm for the art design of future games; in terms of the game engine, Black Myth: Wukong further demonstrates the massive potential of the Unreal 5 engine, more developers will likely turn to it for game development, which will surely bring games with more stunning visual effects and improved optimization in the future; in the Chinese game industry, the huge success of Black Myth: Wukong has overturned the previous monopoly of online games and mobile games in the market. The potential of single-player games will inevitably drive more Chinese developers to invest in it. Even if you discover that this game isn't to your liking, its popularity will surely bear fruit in the future and will be beneficial to the entire gaming industry.

0.8014253973960876,english,"Steam Deck Playability ( 7/10) GOTF ? (100/10) !! DLSS MOD USE Steam Deck LCD Review  So, after extensive research on trying to play this game without too much an issue. Playing it with so called DLSS MOD is VERY RECOMMENDED. Seeing many people saying about how this will struggle in Chapter 2 on forth especially on tiger vanguard and other bosses. I would say, this game can run perfectly by using the mod I mention above.   Chapter 1 Preview Starting from the prologue, i have a bit of problem with the graphics but that all changed after the Prologue. Graphics from Steam Deck is as people know is ALL Set to LOW. However, i set Texture to HIGH because i still can run it great without impacting the performance by a lot. Take in mind, i am using the DLSS MOD. Therefore the Frame Generation is on. In my Steam Settings also i enable Allow Tearing, and Manual GPU Clock set to 1600 MHz with Scaling Filter FSR set to 3 Sharpness. I experiment a lot with this and doing as above, i actually got very good looking graphics with acceptable performance, getting almost 60 fps stable except sometime it might drop to 55-59 or lower depend on the location. However my play in Chapter 1 is almost perfect and i like it very much.  Starting from Chapter 2 Above, I set Texture back to low, because there is pixelated environment and stuttering keep happening. However, i manage to run it stable in 60 fps so it worth the sacrifice. There is still stuttering sometime but i guess this is because loading the environment and so on. My fight with all the bosses does not affect anything much. No lagging input like people mention which is weird. Probably just me, but i am glad everything went smooth .  To put it simply, running DLSS MOD imo is just important if you want to try play in Steam Deck. Take note i also run CryoUtilities and also Wukong with Latest Proton GE-11. This is also been done in Steam Deck LCD. So i dont see how OLED cant run better than this unless you do something wrong. I hope there is optimization been done to make it much better and no need of DLSS MOD.   My Steam Deck Settings:   Frame Limit 60 FPS Allow Tearing Manual GPU Clock 1600MHz Scaling Filter FSR ( Sharpness 3) Game Resolution ( Set in Properties ) = 1280x720 If you use DLSS MOD , Perhaps using lower can improve the performance ( Need testing) [ This is because there is bug using the mod that affect the graphics which i am unsure ]  IN-Game Settings Prefer All Low, OFF everything OFF like V-Sync and Motion Blur for Smooth gameplay. Can make Exception for Texture to set to HIGH depend if you can run it much better or want to sacrfice some performance. Prefer to set to low in Chapter 2 above because just how big the environment is.   From my gameplay and research , WUKONG IS ONE OF A MUST HAVE for HandHeld Console . Of course there is many room for improvement which i hope the dev consider to do so for Steam Deck. I have not being sleeping playing this game for a day and looking for the best way to experience on Steam Deck. For those who have problem with this game being unplayable, try to get the DLSS MOD like i mention and try to do more research just like what i did. You wont regret it !!",3196.0,2024-09-12 05:07:13,Recommended

[/h1]  After spending 113 hours exploring every corner of the game, I’m finally ready to write a review and share my personal opinion on the debut triple-A game by ""Game Science"".  In a nutshell, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is a wonderful game with a varied combat system, a stunning world, great sound, and captivating characters drawn from Chinese folklore.  Now, let’s dive into the details:  Story & Lore The game's roots lie in Chinese folklore, specifically based on the book ""Journey to the West"". Throughout the game, we encounter many characters who appeared in the original story, with their development further explored here. Before ""Black Myth: Wukong"" was released, many expected that we’d play as the real Monkey King, Sun Wukong. However, we actually play as The Destined One, whose mission is to collect the six relics left behind by Wukong. Yet, not everything is as straightforward. [spoiler] In reality, our true mission is to become Sun Wukong, inheriting his legacy and title as the Monkey King. [/spoiler]  Gameplay The combat system is rich with variety, offering a mix of spells, stances, transformations, light and heavy combos, and combined chains of them as well. The game features over 100 bosses, which is an impressive number. Encounters are frequent, leaving little room for rest or boredom. The game is divided into six chapters, each completely distinct from the last.  Sound & Soundtrack I highly recommend playing with the original Chinese voice acting. The work done by the voice actors is phenomenal and truly indescribable. The atmospheric music only elevates the experience, adding tension during boss fights and cutscenes.  Pros and Cons Pros: - Engaging combat with great variety. - A beautiful world filled with secrets to discover. - Deep, mysterious lore and fascinating characters. - Exceptional voice acting and music. - An impressive number and variety of bosses.  Cons: Honestly, I didn’t encounter any major cons while playing, but I can mention a minor issues: invisible walls. Some areas look explorable, but upon getting closer, you find that you can't proceed.  Black Myth: Wukong"" delivers an unforgettable experience, fully immersing you in your own ""Journey to the West"".

It’s so clear that there was a ton of love poured into this game, so many little nods and extra effort put into even the little things that you cant help but be charmed by it all.  It’s very polished, only occurred a couple minor bugs throughout my playthroughs, and once you figure out how the game works and the map progression plays out, it’s very rewarding and plays through smoothly. I will say though, the idea of stances is fun - but I never found much of a reason to swap from the default smash stance and just crank out the big damage.  I don’t really have too many complaints besides the combat being a little spammy, but that kind of works because it lets you focus instead on learning to react to the bosses, rather than managing a ton of complex mechanics on your end.  I 100% the game because I enjoyed the game so much. (Also bought the 8bitdo black myth: wukong edition controller, it's my new go to now.)

It's a fun game to play, not as hard and challenging as Souls games except for some minibosses(After getting stronger you can come back and defeat them. I might have struggled because I was a bit stubborn but some of them really felt unfair.). The action is pretty good but both combos and spells lack variety. There are different stances but they only change your heavy attack, so you end up using the same light attack combo throughout the entire game. Some upgrades allow you to modify your light attacks but it's still not enough.  Enemies between bosses feel too random and sometimes meaningless. Chapters 5 and 6 seem rushed for the deadline. I like the art style and the graphics are way too good. However, the worst thing about this game is the INVISIBLE WALLS.. there are too many of them and you can't go where you should actually be able to. There might be a better solution for this but it seems the game might have been rushed.  In conclusion, the game is fun but doesn't deserve that price.",1052.0,2024-09-26 17:56:11,Recommended
0.6770604252815245,english,"The TLDR version is, yes this is a GOOD game, but definitely not as great as everyone is making it out to be. Looks amazing, it's well optimised (compared to most crap on the market these days), and combat is mostly fun, but that's about where it stops for me. In summary, if you are simply looking for a fast paced martial arts/ ""Samurai"" style game and don't really care about it being new or hyped, I would recommend Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice over this any day.  Here is why (the long version)... As a From Software fanboy and a souls-like veteran, I was excited to see something new and fresh to the genre, and something that may have been able to compete with the aforementioned Sekiro. Black Myth: Wukong starts off strong, but you quickly start to learn all the nuances about the game that make it down right frustrating and, for lack of a better word, crap... here is the list.  - Invisible walls that stop you from exploring areas that look reachable. It gets old really fast.  - There may be a cultural barrier, but the story is simply confusing, disjointed, and doesn't really make sense. It is filled with so much random crap that I stopped caring and started skipping most of the cut-scenes. Not to mention some of the really annoying side characters. I got the main premise of it, but man it was a slog to get through.  - The combat is fast and entertaining, but I would not call it 'crisp' or skill-based. Without writing a 20 page essay on why, just know that you will get 'ripped off' MANY times with missed button presses, interrupted moves, bulls#&t enemy move sets, unavoidable AOE, and just flat out 'cheating' by the bosses. I felt like the combat was too luck-based to be called 'well designed'.  - There are too many 'bosses'. It also gets old real fast. Not to mention, towards mid-game, they just stop dying/ being defeated. They will often flee or just start some random dialog with you before leaving. The satisfaction of ass-kicking gets taken away from you.  - Traversal is tedious and sometimes gets you killed. There is a type of auto-mantle feature that sometimes forces you to jump down ledges you didn't want to. Some of the spawn points are really far from the arena where you died and running there is really annoying.  (Gear Progression in summary: There is a lot of stuff to acquire in this game, but a lot of it feels really pointless.)  - Gear progression is flat-out enraging! For example, there is one armour set that you unlock for crafting quite early, but you don't find all of the materials until much later in the story progression. If you are a completionist like me, it took roughly 20 hours or more to finally craft it! Yes, I could have skipped a bunch of stuff and got the materials, but that many hours is just ridiculous! I kept thinking to myself, ""Oh yeah, it can't be far off now."" This also carries over to upgrading. Another slogfest to get high-end materials.  - Gear progression cont... When you finally do get a piece of gear that you think is going to be amazing, it usually comes with a negative effect or such a small benefit that just makes it not worth it equipping. The game forces you into certain gear for the set bonuses and towards the late-game you just end up using whatever is best. In the late-game, you get a bunch of different gear that gets thrown at you and makes you wonder why you spent your hard earned money/ materials on the other crap. Yes you can make 'random builds' but they are very limited if you actually want to be 'powerful'.  - The skill progression is quite good, but also has some pointless aspects to it. You have 3 different stances for combat, but the gear is usually focused around one of them, making it utterly pointless to switch between them. Again, focusing you into whichever is best for the time. Same goes for your sub-items as well, usually focusing on one particular skill or spell that makes the others pointless. The fact that re-specing is free and easy is a really good part of this game, but honestly I just ran the whole game with one stance at a time. It feels like the game wants you to experiment with different builds and skills, but it is just not worth it.  To finalise: I really struggled to recommend this game, but I have a personal rule that if I have a decent amount of hours or have completed it, it must have been worth it. If you are expecting 'crisp' skill-based combat, like some other games in similar genres, I would not recommend this. You will end up breaking something. It is a really good game from a developer's first 'big title', but they missed the mark on so many things that it just made it frustrating to play for me. It's almost like they 'tried to hard' and added a lot of unnecessary crap, which just ends up conflicting with enjoying the game. Anyway, sorry to ramble, but I felt it needed to be said.

It's not without its share of flaws (what game is, really?), but as first effort from a newly formed studio this was nothing short of an outstanding achievement.    Solid and mostly satisfying combat, good level design with tons of branching paths and secrets to uncover, staggering amount AND variety of content (with an absurd number of very distinctive boss fights), excellent production value and cinematography across the board, decent level of challenge from some of the toughest bosses (I think goddamn Erlang made me piss way more blood than anything in a FromSoft game so far), etc, etc.    Personally the only glaring issues I can point and the things I'd like to see improved in their future games are:    - they should work on ways to eliminate or mask their ""invisible walls"" more seamlessly. Stumbling on one currently can be fairly jarring, especially because it seems to be an almost unnecessary oversight, given the overall technical prowess of the game.    - the formula would benefit from having more advanced navigation and traversal options unlocked over time (Metroidvania-style). You know... double jumping, a grappling hook, breaking special walls, that sort of stuff.    - While the combat is more good than bad (at least good enough to count as a net positive for the game) I would appreciate if they could make everything a bit tighter: better sense of impact on receiving and landing hits, clearer""tells"" from enemy moves, a bit less ""visual noise"" in the most frantic moments of action.      On a side note, I have no idea why so many reviewers insist on stressing that ""this isn't really a Souls-like"", because I can't think of any other series that it resembles more closely.  The way the content is paced, the checkpoint system, the fact that everything except bosses respawns if you die or rest, how healing and consumable work... These are all almost a 1:1 match to most From Software title, and even the camera, lock-on system and combat are way closer to a Sekiro than they are to, say, a God of War or Devil May Cry.    Anyway, to say I was pleased with the time I spent on the game would be an understatement.  It's currently an easy candidate for my personal GOTY 2024 with nothing in sight ready to challenge it (but I have yet to play a remaining good half of Shadow of the Elder Tree).     I'll be there for whatever this studio comes up with next.  Well, at least in the hope they'll capitalize on what they learned here if they don't decide to swap genre entirely.

It is a shame that the current state of the game includes a major design flaw that ruins an otherwise stellar experience.  It is one that is [b]so bad that I find it hard to press on playing after almost a week of play[/b]. In the interest of fairness to the parts of the Wukong development team that actually did a great job, the following aspects of the game are deserving of its currently [i]Overwhelmingly Positive[/i] review status:  [b]Pros[/b] [list] [*] Enemy Design [*] Combat  [*] Sound/Music [*] Stability/Optimization [*] Voice Acting (English) [/list]  However, the one team that absolutely did not live up to the level of quality that their peers delivered is the Level Design team.   [list] [*] [b]Not because the levels do not look good[/b] -- [i]the environments look stunning.[/i]   [*] [b]Not because there is no map or map overlay[/b] -- [i]I have played other similar games with no map (e.g. Lies of P) where the lack of a map did not bother me.[/i] [*] [b]Not because of the cryptic steps required to unlock secret areas[/b] -- [i]Elden Ring did the same thing and while I did not like it, it was not a deal breaker[/i] [/list] The killing blow to the experience for this game is the [b]Boundary Design[/b].  This game should have never been released with this level of lazy implementation of Player Boundary Design.  It is utterly inexcusable to price your game at the AAA level when it is clear that there was less effort put into player boundary design and QA testing than a Nintendo 64 release. Navigating through levels in this game feels like [b]walking through a 10'x10' glass corridor[/b] where you never know if you are going to smash your face on the the glass a few feet where a wall or drop in elevation appears to be or if said change in elevation is actually a path of progression.    [b]Cons[/b] [list] [*] Inconsistency between level visuals and level boundaries [*] Boss arenas often contain player boundaries which do not also affect the boss [*] Boss arena boundaries sometimes seem to be a fraction of what the arena appears to be [/list] The ever-present level of inconsistency with visual indicators of game boundaries and the actual enforced game boundaries makes level navigation and exploration tedious at best.  I do not find it fun to brush up against or jump at everything that looks like a boundary in order to determine if it actually is.  This lack of visual consistency is a big letdown as many of the secret paths contain very useful rewards but the sheer tedium of brute-force invisible wall testing is exhausting to the point where I no longer want to play.    The final insult thrust upon me by the Level Design team was in the 3rd chapter where . . . [spoiler] after you fight a certain boss on a mountain path there is a shiny item on a nearby ledge.  After more than 30 minutes of trying to find a path to that area I discovered that you need to fall off of the edge of a nearby cliff to find a lower path, which I found immensely insulting as the game spent the last 40 hours teaching me that cliff edges = invisible walls.  But now I am supposed to ignore all of that and just try it because . . . you know what, it doesn't matter because I am not playing your game anymore.[/spoiler]   If this ever gets fixed I will change my review, and if on the infinitely unlikely chance that the Wukong Game Director reads this review -- allow me to pose a hypothetical question for you:   [hr][/hr] ""If you went to a 5 Star Steakhouse and ordered their most expensive steak.  You receive the meal and it looks and smells wonderful but you find that you can not cut off a piece from the side.  The Chef tells you that the outer 1/3 of the steak is inedible but you can cut from the middle.  You take a cut from the middle and it tastes well above your expectations.  The second cut from the middle also tastes just as good if not better, but on your 3rd bite you taste nothing at all.  The Chef then explains that 1/3 of the inner portion is inadvertently devoid of taste"" [hr][/hr] What kind of review would you leave for that Restaurant?  [b]Edit[/b] As a few people have noticed, my gametime is increasing even though I stated above that I would no longer play the game.  In reality I am working on a mod which requires having the game executable open in order to inspect and query game assets.  I anticipate I am no more than a few weeks away from having that released and will post to NexusMods when it is ready. However, I am willing to make an implied agreement with this game studio -- whether they ever end up seeing this or not: Both you and I know how poorly the Level Bounds execution is in this game, I have seen it and you are intimately familiar with it.  Your UE [i]Landscape Collision Splines[/i] look fine and are only marginally overextended compared to the elevations that define them.  On the other hand . . . the [i]LevelBounds BoxComponents[/i] and vector defined [i]BGWBlockingVolumes[/i] are atrocious.  It is almost as if there were two separate teams responsible for those.  Your bounds often coverup areas that themselves have appropriate mesh collision which begs the question of why they were added in the first place. Now it is time for the DEAL. . . If you beat me in releasing an update that addresses the substandard boundary implementation elements . . . not only will I change my review to positive, but I will also not release my mod or any videos which may expose the embarrassing level of quality on display in your boundary design.  I say this knowing full well that the audience I would reach would be miniscule.  but you never know, it may end up reaching someone who actually does have an audience and they may run with it.

0.5985814332962036,english,"[h3]One of the best adventure games ever[/h3]    Developers had an advantage of taking a very well developed world and one of the most famous story in it. And they not only took it but they delivered on it. Game has wide variety of enemies each of them has it's own backstory (obviously taken from chinese folklore but still) which slightly enlarge our understanding of the world. And just this world and story is enough to give this game a try even if you are not a fan of any other aspects of the game.    Game consists of 6 chapters each of which has it's unique enemy cast (with exception of ch5) and corresponding bosses. I remember entering ch5 and my thought ""lol those enemies are just reskins of earlier ones lazy devs"". But in any other game I would just perceive this as a norm and the fact that I perceived this as a minus speaks very highly about enemy variety in the game.    Bosses divides in two parts - chiefs and kings. Difficulty-wise they are mixed up, kings just have more shiny moves I guess...  Bosses in a vacuum are all awesome - they has their place in the world, they has a backstory, they have cool moves and good loot. Also they are balanced pretty good for an adventure game even tho I wish they was harder cos amount of bosses I just first try facetanked is unhealthy in my opinion. On the other hand I heard that some people struggles a lot on different bosses so my opinion is not objective here. And yes, I also struggled on those two bosses :)    Maps are also awesome - with unique biomes and gorgeous views. They are normal adventure type maps with branching path to the end boss. But game doesn't have any map in menu so navigating and finding all secrets can be quite time consuming (especially in ch3).  Chapter 6 map is failed (in my opinion) experiment on openworld type of map. There is literally nothing in it except for a few bad bosses and 1 (one!) chest.    Why ch6 bosses are bad? I hate 2 types of bosses: ""puzzle"" boss and ""catch me bitch"" boss. They are like 90% of ch6 bosses :(    But game is not without technical problems of course  First of all - camera. Camera can get behind a tree or a wall which is annoying. Also camera tracking is quite loose so if you move around around the boss too much or if boss is has very mobile moveset - he will be out of your field view for a good 30+% of a fight. Also you can just lose target lock during some of boss moves if you don't manually readjust camera during fight (which is annoying if you use gamepad).  Minor problem with inputs - for example run button won't register if you pressed it before your run-prohibiting move ends.  And annoying problem with lack of target tracking. Like you know how lazy boss designers adds insane target tracking to all moves of bosses - here designers went deeper - heavy attack after roll in 75% of cases will just miss the mark completely - it's not hitting where enemy was, nor where he is going, just some random particle in the air, which is extremely frustrating after you spent like a minute to charge this attack.    But despite these problems game is still awesome, bosses are still very manageable due to variety of builds (and ability to redo your build at any time).

I'm not a souls genre player, and I rarely play action oriented games, but I'm used to play other kind of games that requires a lot of trials and errors or practice to enjoy, therefore I wasn't shocked by the perceived difficulty of the game.  The game is only slightly open world with a few side quests scattered around the map, it feels mostly linear with the exception of the last chapter where suddenly the game went even more open with less linearity on how to approach the map.  I think it's useless to describe the gameplay and the positives of this game, there arethousands of other reviews you can read and watch, but to me the biggest downside of the game is on the narration side.  The narration is disjointed, requires you to have some level of familiarity with the original source material and requires you to have some level of understanding about Chinese socio-cultural contexts as well as Buddhism and Daoism to fully appreciate the story.  Another bad thing for me is that most of the game world building lore is locked inside the game pause menu that will only get unlocked after you met or bested enemies, I think this is a staple of souls genre and as an RPG player I think it's a massive fail as it's the opposite from RPG that tries to immerse you in the world of the game, in here it became distraction and is totally unimmerisve.  You can get that from YouTube that covers them, but as a stand alone game and story that is a massive fail on part of the developers.  Aside from that performance wise the game continues the tradition of UE5 games that at times can offer amazing visuals but other times are not, riddled with stutters and unreasonable performance. And to make it worse somehow the game has no native HDR support, I could enable the UE5 HDR with .ini editing but it result in UI ghosting issue.  Ultrawide 21:9 is natively supported with a few minor issues.

0.5931400060653687,english,"I really wanted to like this game, but it falls victim to many poor design decisions and I found the game far more tedious and frustrating than it should be.  First off, the game is gorgeous, the cutscenes are fun, and I'm sure the story is great, though I struggled to follow along since I'm not familiar with JTTW. The game ran almost flawlessly on my machine as well.  But I found the combat too simple, the customization and skill trees are shallow, and overall the whole game was pretty repetitive. 25 hours of doing the same light attack spam, followed by a heavy attack, got tiring quickly. Games centered entirely around the combat need some more variation to keep it interesting.  Level design is bland, the fodder/non-boss enemies are often too easy and there's so much running in this game, the levels are huge, exploration felt slow and tedious.  The bosses are the best part of the game, I found myself bored in the sections between bosses and just couldn't wait to get to the next one.  But then the bosses start getting really rough at the end of chapter 4 and beyond. There is a lot of artificial difficulty that can turn such a cool spectacle of a fight to something you just want to be over because it's really just that unfun. Like a boss will remove 70% of your stamina bar, or make your dodges slower, or put 6 aoe tornadoes that just follow you around half of the fight that nuke your health bar etc. Some fights have some major hitbox issues too. Also boss HP is too high in the late game, fights drag on and on.  80 tries to beat an Elden Ring boss was far more fun than 20-30 tries to beat one of the stinkier fights later in this game.

0.589840829372406,english,"Black Myth Wukong is a fun action game that takes inspiration from a bunch of modern games to create it's own thing. The gameplay structure, level design, navigation, menus and gear upgrades remind me heavily of the recent god of war games, while the combat feels like a mesh of games like Sekiro and Nioh. It does things different enough though and the quality is there that it doesn't feel like a blatant rip off.   The game’s visuals are really good. The attention to detail in character models, environments, and special effects is nothing short of impressive. The art direction beautifully captures the essence of Chinese mythology, it feels both otherworldly and grounded in cultural authenticity.  The combat is initially exciting, with fast-paced action and a variety of abilities and transformations that keep things interesting. However, as you progress, the combat begins to feel repetitive. Despite the initial thrill, the lack of variety in the combos makes going through these levels start to feel like a chore because you are mashing the same light attack combo with the same animation for over 30 hours. The different stances don't offer the variety needed because they are just heavy attack finishers after doing the same light attack combo. All the fundamentals are there, i just needed more animation variety when i was spamming that light attack. The boss design however is a particular standout, with each encounter feeling unique and all the different movesets make every fight feel fresh. The sheer number of bosses is very impressive, its the aspect of the game they definitely went all out on.  The level design was disappointing. While the environments are visually stunning, the actual design of the levels feels too basic and bland. Chapter 2 and 3 in particular a lot of the time feel like wastelands of desert and snow that you are just running through, they lack density. This mixed with the repetitive combat makes navigating these levels feel like a chore at times just hoping to get to the next boss soon.   The story didn't do much for me. It's is rooted in rich folklore and it relies heavily on it while failing to tell a story on it's own. The writing is way too vague to get me invested in any way. The atmosphere, on the other hand, remains captivating throughout, driven by the strong world-building and mythical elements.  Overall it's a good game with standout visuals, impressive boss design, and a unique setting, but it falls short from being anything more than that personally due to the repetitive combat, bland level design and a lackluster story. 7/10 (Good)",2608.0,2024-09-02 13:17:08,Recommended
0.5867357850074768,english,"Your enjoyment of this game heavily relies on your knowledge of the source material or tolerance for soulslike games. I meet neither requirement so for a majority of the 50h I played, I did not have a good time. I was expecting a retelling of the Journey in game format, instead it's an OC sequel to a novel I never read and doesn't even progress the story all that much beyond what is already known.    Story wise you meet and fight back to back bosses nearly constantly with no context as to why they want you dead and they don't even say anything besides ""En garde!"" before assaulting you.    Gameplay is decent enough to keep you engaged throughout but again the boss rush will sour your playthrough as many of these bosses heavily rely on cheap gimmicks to trip you up during fights like delayed attacks, phase changes where they float in the air for almost a full minute or grabs that instantly shreds half of your HP.  The worst offender was Chapter 3, being the longest and a genuine chore to get through as it was the length of both previous chapters combined in total and the final boss had two phase transitions that are cutscenes where you take unavoidable half HP damage and a gold form where he's immune to your basic attacks.   While fighting him and searching for tips online I also found out that every boss can input read you charging up for a heavy attack and will back away or dash into you when you start doing so.. Absolutely horrendous and unfair design imo but little irritating tricks like these exist in all of the others to artificially inflate difficulty and force you to die again and again until you ""get good"" like the average soulslike masochist would say.    I forced myself to the end waiting to see how long it takes to get good and to my surprise it did, near the end. The secret final boss as well as the final boss himself were beautifully crafted and fairly challenging without relying on the previous gimmicks other bosses would pull. Unfortunately this came at around 40h in my playthrough.    In the end I do regret getting roped into the hype train and paying full price for this. I think I'd have been happier with a 30€ price tag a couple months down the line. This is not the end all be all of gaming some people are acting like it is. It just happens to be a decent 7/10 game not plagued by the usual forced agendas we're tired of hearing about.

0.5772515535354614,english,"8/10 for action RPG veteran 1/10 for casual player  Here are the reason why I rated it like this: 1)	This game is on the harder end of the general gaming spectrum. It is not meant for casual player. There is only 1 difficulty. There is no “play for the story” mode. 2)	The game design is extremely lacking in information. There is no map, no quest tracking, no info on combination. Translation of skills and information is bad or outright wrong. All the information I learn are from 3rd party website. Things like, what does resolution strike actually do, what is the counter input, how much dmg does focus attack worth, where to get what items, what skills scale, what doesn’t, etc. Is like the developer purposely refuse to give even general information to the player. Like how long does a immobilize skill last? They wont say. You have to find out from 3rd party, who then experiment and put it on a spread sheet. Purposely withholding information, is not a skill. I find all the information online anyway, whats the point of having bad description, no numbers on spell time , no map, no quest tracking???? 3)	The boss fights are hard. Yes I know, players who are used to dark soul, will probably gate keep and say its easy, everyone can do it. But the game is hard for the casual player base who have never play dark soul before. I will use Witcher 3 death march as a comparison. This game is probably 50 times harder. Why? Because the attack timing vs doge timing is extremely tight. We are talking about a fraction of a second. And the boss will have 3-6 attacks per attack pattern. And about 4-8 attack patterns per boss. Boss are usually big, dash, aoe, and a mix of instant teleport or delay attacks.  Which mean, if you are casual player, you will use the first 5-10 deaths just learning the attacks and when is safe to doge. Than you have to die another 5-10 times, to learn when its safe to attack. Because your attacks will not stun anyone, unless it has focus points. And boss regular light attack will stun you, and at times chain stun you. So if you eat the first attack, you might eat the whole thing. 3-6 attacks can probably kill you, unless you are over level. And yea, you know those official review that said this game is a button mashing?? You cant do that. If you just mash input like doge, you will get hit, because the boss will track where you land if you don’t time it right. In fact, any player who haven’t learn those doge mechanics will have a hard time getting out of charpter 2. Don’t believe me, just google youtube fights with charpter 1 boss like the wandering weight, or the white clan noble. And of course, tiger vanguard, that cat that has probably break many controllers. 4)	The story is amazing, but there is not enough cut scene to show it. If you read the massive paragraph for each character, you will find most boss have a sad and worth tell story. If you don’t read it, (I cant bother reading all of them) they are just another boss to kill. (Most of them are annoying and required 5-50 deaths to memorise their attack pattern)   I hope those reading understand why I give 2 different rating. I do regret buying this game to a certain extend. But I don’t want politics to win, so I gladly keep this and slowly finishing this game. But I wont be buying its next instalment. I don’t have the time to play such a high skill cap game. If I didn’t know there is not difficulty setting, I probably wont spend time on this.  Ps: I want to add one more point, this game doesn’t feel like I am building a RPG. Because a lot of the items are locked behind a certain boss clear. You can increase your level, but you cant “craft” an advance item until you clear a certain area. Weapons and amor are hard locked by area. If only this game have a lower difficulty setting...    =======================================================================  Update 27/oct/2024    I rarely review games, nor do I update review. But I have since complete ng+, a little bit of NG2+, and a new start on chap 1 to give some perspective. I have also used the tanking building for NG+ as well. So here goes:  1.	Invisible walls make this game very sad as it confused players where to go 2.	There are inconsistent in game rule in terms where a player can fall and die. Like 1% of the whole game. 3.	Boss fights, are mixed of easy to frustratingly hard. Its due to my review’s reasons. The hard bosses all have a certain characteristics; Large, bad hit boxes, aggressive and attack 80% of a time, you missed one doge and you might die taking 3-5 hits in a row with no recovery, Jumping or flying all over the place, which reduce time to hit the boss, stupid delay and fast attack mixed up, very large hp, + commend grab that does a lot of damage. Everyone have different opinions who are the top bosses to fight. But I think for the top 30%, the bosses all have the above characteristic. 4.	Story telling isn’t that amazing. Its there, but they could easily triple the cut sene to tell the story. Like charpter 2, they could have show what happen to the city and why the people become who they are. Instead, all you get is words. 5.	Music is very good 10/10 6.	So is graphic, 10/10 7.	RPG in terms of building a character that you want? 3/10. Especially for first play through, my god … Items are hard locked behind boss clear. The starting staff you will use for the whole 1st ch. You cant even upgrade damage till the game lets you build the next staff. 8.	In game description still absolutely suck 3 month after release. No numbers, everything you need, you will find on website. Not in game. Things like rock solid timing, damage with 4 focus point, defence rating calculation. Like its 2024, which is developer expecting gamers to work out these number on 3rd party website??? Are we in 1994, where the developer is selling a separate guild???  Conclusion. Look guys. This game is so damn polarizing. Like.. on your first play thru on chapter one, you will die a lot. When I play it againt from the 2nd time, I still die like 10-20 times. That’s with all the knowledge I know. I cant switch stances, cause not enough level. I cant use cloud steps till after kill black bear once. I definitely have no access to damage reduction gear or the full bull king set. So I have to doge everything . I don’t have rock solid, and no thrust stance till level 20. So, charpter 1 fresh start, at least for the bosses is actually harder than NG6+ with good gear. Like I can do 80% reduction+ 700 defense, + full bull king set, and I wont be stagger and can kill bosses in Ng +++++. I might not be perfect but I have luxury to make mistakes. First play thru, I don’t have any of that Luxury.  So…how should I sum up this game? Should I say its soul like? Maybe its easy after NG+? Goty? Well, given how inperfect this game is, and that there are no difficulty setting, no I don’t think this is GOTY. Developer wants players to master doging, and than mixed in heavy attacks and special attacks, and spirits, and spells. Which is why on youtube, you can see those pros with no hit runs. Which is cool from their perspective. But what about the entire gaming community and the gaming consumers??? Are we all expected to have those perfect run to beat bosses? For the 1st chapter of your first play thru…pretty close that’s what you need. And the word I have heard that IMO best describes this game is that it is a “Dodging simulator”.   So…is this game worth buying? I don’t think I can answer that. Because if you are good with these type of games. Sure. If you are 50 years old, and you want to come home after work and just chill for like an hour. Then I would say no. I think…thats a fair comment to make. If only there are lower difficulty, I would rate this a good 7/10 for everyone. But if time is important, then really why should someone spend their good time to memorize a boss attack pattern???? I am glad I beat this game.  I hope this summery help for those reading this.",7988.0,2024-09-15 08:42:30,Not Recommended

0.5741496682167053,english,"I have wrote exactly one review in my 14 or so years of using steam, and it's this review right now.  I will organize this into things I liked and things I didn't like, and at the end my overall score (x/10).  [b]DISCLAIMER[/b]: This is my personal experience with the game and my thoughts. I also made it to the end of chapter 4 before feeling like I wanted to write this review. I do not care if 70 billion people think this is GOTY material. If you love the game, that's honestly great. There are a sincere lack of new, well made, and fun ""AAA"" games, and if you can find one that you like, I'm genuinely happy for you.  Also, since I did not make it all the way through the game, I won't be making a judgement on the boss mechanics, hitboxs, etc. I know quite a few people had problems with that, but I did not encounter a similar problem.  ----------------------------------------- [b]WHAT I LIKED[/b]:  SETTING: There aren't that many games that cover Chinese mythology in detail, or at least not many that get as much media coverage as this game did. It's highly refreshing to see something other than high European fantasy (even though I'm a sucker for em). I haven't read Journey to the West or watched/listened to any media about it, but this game has made me more curious of the actual story and of Chinese mythology in general.  GRAPHICS: Holy moly, this game is pretty. Even before the boss designs, the levels look amazing. There is a slight hiccup with each level looking a bit monochromatic (sand, sand, and more sand), but the vistas and key areas all follow their own theme, which matches the bosses and make them feel lived in by the actual creatures that you encounter. Additionally, the boss designs are all top tier. No real problems with the bosses on my end from a graphical standpoint. Animations, art design, and effects all look epic and make you feel pretty small at times, which is what I'm assuming they were going for.   And of course all the later game armor sets and staves were sick as heck. (Too bad you can't get some staves until NG+)  INTERFACE: Sleek and non-intrusive. All the things you can ask for. There was a learning curve to using the RT on the controller to access your other abilities, but once I got used to it, I was comboing my spirits and transformation with ease and was a highlight to the combat.  ----------------------------------------- [b]WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE[/b]:  INVISIBLE WALLS: Yeah yeah, I know. I'm not going to wax poetic about the insurmountably liberal use of invisible walls and their intrusive and odd placements. However, there is one other huge gripe that I want to point out, and that is their use in boss arenas. If the boss can jump through the invisible wall and attack me through it. Sorry, that is just bad design. The last boss of chapter 2 was honestly one of my least favorite solely because of this. Thankfully, I didn't encounter it again on any other boss, and I don't know if it even happens again to my knowledge. But yeah, invisible wall bad.  STORYTELLING: The translations for this game were challenging to understand, and I really had no idea of what was going on in the story. I understand that that might be due to the nature of how the original story is told. I also know that Game Science made a lot of changes to the story. So I'm not sure how true it is to the original or how that could affect the game's storytelling. Making adjustments to the translations to make it more understandable for players who haven't experienced this story before or this type of mythology and would have gone a long way .  PERFORMANCE: The game is pretty, but man, they really turned the dial up too much some times. The frame drops in this game make certain bosses unplayable at times due to the gobsmacking amount of particle effects. Fighting any of the Loongs with their lightning might as well be actual lightning striking my computer, which is a shame since they are some of the cooler fights in the game. This also wasn't isolated to just one chapter, almost all the chapters I played through had some sort of performance issue at various points. I have no problem fighting Consort Radahn with his five million light particles or the Divine Beast with their various storm effects in Elden Ring, but god forbid I get lightning dragons or sand in this game.  ENEMIES: This is an issue I had with Sekiro on my second and third playthrough. The regular joe-blow enemies and their frequency just prove to be an annoyance. They aren't particularly challenging or interesting and just serve to lengthen the play time. In a boss rush game with no other gameplay mechanics (i.e platforming, puzzle solving, exploration, etc) I do not care about anything else other than the bosses/story/combat. It would be a bit different if there was some diversity to the combat or gameplay, but that is a topic for later.  COMBAT: And by later, I mean now. This one is going to be pretty lengthy since this is the driving point of the game, and I will split this up among a few key pain points of the combat.  [b]Animations[/b]: Speaking of animations, what in tarnation is going on with the animation locking? I don't know if this is actually what people mean by ""animation locking"", but it is supremely annoying not being able to perform combat actions until full animations have been performed. Performing magic roots you in place and you must perform the entire character animation, even if the spell has already finished casting e.g freeze spell. Dodge rolls do not cancel animations like other action RPGS, which makes the combat feel very clunky. It also forces you into one or two specific ways to play the game.  [b]Combat Diversity[/b]: Or lack thereof. The combat boils down to pretty much ""save focus for big hit"". There isn't a consistent way to CC the bosses, since some can't actually be knocked down or stunned. This makes the combat loop devolve into one-two light attacks until you have focus for a fully charged heavy. There is a skill that doesn't interrupt your light combo by dodge rolling. However, most of the bosses have 3-7 attack combos that time out that particular parameter. And yes, there are the ""varied combos"". I'll talk about those in detail later, but those have their own quirks that interrupt the flow combat substantially.   [b]Stagger[/b]: I've mentioned stagger previously, and it is honestly one of the main reasons I stopped playing for now. Bosses staggering me or knocking me down is no big deal. I expect these much more powerful enemies to knock me on my ass. However, when every regular enemy can stagger me out of my combos while I'm flying around with my staff, but I can only stagger them once or twice during a light combo, that just removes the fun. There a stat called tenacity in the game, but you don't get armor for it until way later. Just let me do cool stuff man.  [b]Varied Combos[/b]: I'm not going to sugar coat this. These are not good. I had such high hopes for the combat in general because of these, but I got majorly disappointed. These are just worse versions of the charged heavy attacks of their respective stances. They have a long recovery time after performing them that you end up getting hit 99% of the time after using them. The healing is cool, but worse than just using the bo staff that heals on 3 focus heavy attacks. And the so called ""counters"" can't be performed on the fly and have the narrowest window I've seen for a ""counter/parry"". If you want to parry, just use rock solid.  There's more I'd like to write down, but I'm running out of room. These are the major points, good and bad, from my experience. TLDR: The game looks amazing, and is set in a woefully underappreciated mythology. However, the combat sucks a lot of fun from the game along with major performance issues.   Maybe I was expecting too much or this wasn't really what I was looking for in an action RPG. Either way 6/10 for me and a no to recommend since it costs $60.",7986.0,2024-09-11 00:49:53,Not Recommended
0.5726156830787658,english,"[h1] The best game of 2024 [/h1]  The first thing I want to disclose is that this game is NOT a souls-like in a traditional sense. You will not find the same mechanics from a souls game here, but you will find a unique combat experience with satisfying mechanics and difficulty behind it. It is difficult, but I don't think souls-like is an accurate description. It feels like it's akin to God of War with different combat mechanics behind it and a completely different setting.  [h2] Combat [/h2]  The combat in this game is up there for being some of the most fun to mess around with. Being able to use spells and transformations during the fight makes the combat feel so different each run which is super fun for replaying and the fights are pretty balanced around them, using them as strategic tools rather than just being a crutch.   The boss designs in this game are all very unique, it feels like there is constantly something new thrown into the next fight and whilst there are some points where some bosses are considerably harder than others, there isn't a time where you're stuck for too long on a hard boss because you have so many different spells and tools to try together and see what works and what doesn't.  The different staff stances that can be swapped mid-fight is really dynamic and adds another layer to the combat, whilst I stuck with smash stance for the majority of the game I did find use for the other stances for different fights.  [h2] Exploration [/h2]  The exploration in Black Myth Wukong is pretty straightforward most of the time but there is a lot of optional content to find in later chapters, especially chapter 3 and 4. The size of chapter 3 alone is absolutely insane and I had a lot of fun trying to find every boss, upgrade item and other items. It feels really rewarding to go and explore thoroughly and it adds a lot to the world when you find optional bosses that add to the story.  [h2] Story [/h2]  The storytelling is very heavily drawn from Journey to the West, which you should absolutely learn about before or after playing because it is a very interesting story that this game is based on, and you might be able to pick up on key details from Journey to the West. The premise of Sun Wukong basically no longer being around and as the destined one, we journey up the mountain with the 6 relics to carry on his name and title is a very good way to make a game around Sun Wukong without being outright overpowered in every way possible and it makes sense with the story. Each story boss has a cool story behind them, and the post-chapter cutscenes are incredible to watch and each have their own art style to them.  [h2] Progression [/h2]  The core story progression for each chapter is collecting the relic from the final fight in each chapter, which are each very unique and fun to fight in their own regards (except for chapter 2 because wind tornado is kinda boring). The overall progression with the skill tree has a lot of cool upgrades behind them and there's a lot to choose from with the sheer volume of spells and transformation upgrades that make your character stronger.   [h2] Conclusion [/h2]  Overall, I am surprised this game did not win GOTY for 2024. It could be due to the performance being quite demanding of mid to high-end hardware but I personally didn't find many issues when revisiting. I give this game a 10/10 for its massive amount of content to play through and for having such an immersive world and story to base a game on. It's insane that we are able to actually play a game based on Journey to the West and Sun Wukong who is only really depicted in a limited amount of media.",3658.0,2024-09-03 02:42:34,Recommended

0.5683770775794982,english,"Black Myth: Wukong proved to be an unforgettable experience, especially as my first completed Souls-like game. The stunning visuals produced by the Unreal Engine 5 and rich interpretation of Journey to the West lore were captivating, making every moment feel like part of a larger mythic tapestry.  Each chapter in Black Myth: Wukong stands out for its distinct biomes, landscapes, and enemy types, but also varies in how populated it is with key characters and plot events. Initially looking through the gameplay i thought the game would be linear but no you can unlock a ton of secrets by exploring through the various hidden paths throughout the journey and unlock new staffs or some key items which could help you in the upcoming boss fights.  The first chapter was short and introduced the basic game mechanics with fairly easy bosses which was fun and sparked the interest to proceed further into the story. Second , Third , Fourth chapters were massive with a lot of secrets and bosses to be unveiled . Fifth and Sixth chapters fell a bit short imo . Although at that point i was having too much fun and wanted more content.  The combat was challenging but incredibly rewarding, with tight mechanics that demanded precision and adaptability. Every boss fight felt like an epic showdown, pushing me to improve and think strategically. While some sections were particularly grueling, the sense of achievement after overcoming them was unparalleled. Combat Mechanics were fairly easy to understand and implement in tough situations during boss fights. There are 3 stances with different moveset. The spells and transformations are a great addition accroding to the lore of the original story, using them strategically makes the boss fights lot easier.  Despite the visual complexity, the game runs surprisingly smoothly. I encountered minimal bugs, and the load times are quick.

0.5655199885368347,english,"2024 - The year of monke.  A really excellent souls-like action RPG based around ancient Chinese mythology with beautiful graphics, inventive and weird boss designs and super fluid combat. There's so many cool abilities and moves to unlock and they all feel badass to execute. Every magic power has it's use and you'll need them because this game is pretty tough.  There's mechanics inspired by Dark Souls but the combat feels more similar to hack n slash games like Devil May Cry or the old school God Of War games, it's fast and frantic whereas the Souls games are more deliberate. I didn't do much research on the game before buying other than knowing it's a monke-like so this was really surprising and cool.  Everything feels so slick and nice to control, i don't really have many complaints. I have so much more to do in the game but i'm already convinced that this is definitely one of the best games of the year.  Also a big budget AAA game which released with no game breaking bugs, microtransactions or dumbass agenda other than letting you play as a superhero monke man?

0.5654886960983276,english,"Visually incredible but the gameplay is extremely inconsistent. The level design is pretty much a non-factor, the landscapes are beautiful but gameplay-wise, they're just settings to whale on lesser yaoguai. Many of said lesser yaoguai are immense damage sponges which means taking them out is more of a chore than I'd prefer. This doesn't make them harder to deal with, mind you, they're almost all trivially easy to stunlock when you get them one on one which is 90%+ of your encounters with them. At its worst the level design devolved into major jank, with thin planks to walk across while trying to deflect arrows, an action which would sometimes just send you falling into the abyss as a result of its animation. Many areas looked accessible in the world but upon closer inspection were blocked off by a low rock that your character should be able to jump over with ease. In general the levels' visual layout constantly remind you that you're in a game world. Since you aren't really here for the levels, you'd hope that either the narrative or the bosses would be the real show stoppers. The narrative didn't really do it for me. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special, even by game standards, and it was marred by what I can only imagine was a mediocre translation; dialogue was extremely clunky in places and fully nonsensical in others. The bosses were more of a mixed bag. All were visually captivating, some were mechanically interesting, and some were horrible. In general the combat is a little too floaty, giving too little visual and auditory feedback on dealing or receiving damage to be truly satisfying. I've seen this game sold as somewhere between a Dark Souls and a God of War on the gameplay style and I can see that, but it lacks the visceral feel of the combat in either series and thus finds itself inferior to both. The worst boss fight I completed before giving up was the dragon in the third area, which constantly floats just high enough that your attacks have maybe a 60% chance of landing. It's not a difficult fight and I cleared it on my second try but it feels more like a fight against janky design than the challenging foe the dragons design should represent. Ultimately the only thing that really impressed me here was the visuals.",2275.0,2024-09-03 04:00:51,Not Recommended

Thanks to Game Science, Black Myth: Wukong captures that magic perfectly. In fact, this game already has my vote for Game of the Year. Everything about it feels exceptional. The lore remains faithful to the original Journey to the West tale, though Baije's character has been slightly altered in a way that adds a fresh and positive twist.  The combat is truly among the best I've experienced—precise, well-balanced, and challenging without ever feeling unfair. Visually, the game is stunning, with top-tier graphics and animation made possible by Unreal Engine 5. The soundtrack is both memorable and atmospheric, and the sound design feels incredibly lifelike.  However, the game isn't without its shortcomings. Performance can sometimes be inconsistent, even on high-end systems, and invisible walls (which define the game's borders) can detract from immersion, popping up frequently. On rare occasions, you might even find yourself stuck in certain areas. Additionally, the story might be difficult to fully grasp for Western players who are unfamiliar with Chinese culture, Buddhism, or the Journey to the West narrative, requiring some research to fully appreciate the game's depth.  Despite these minor flaws, I wholeheartedly recommend Black Myth: Wukong.

Now, let's discuss what impressed me: First and foremost is the combat, which is the most abundant in the game, and it feels incredibly satisfying to me, with a very strong sense of impact. Especially the quadruple charge and slash. The slow motion given by the stun, dodge, and the timing of the instant kill is a significant positive feedback, indicating that this operation is very good. Each boss has a distinct characteristic, making the battles never dull, with a special mention to Yang Jian, even after fighting him dozens of times, I still thoroughly enjoy the battle with him.  Secondly, the sound effects. For me, my pursuit of sound effects might even surpass my appreciation for visuals. The stun sound effects, the quadruple charge sound effects, the sound of weapons hitting the Yellow Browed Monster, the sound of the Copper Head and Iron Arm spinning, the sound of the Ruyi Jingu Bang appearing, and so on, all make me feel as if celestial music is echoing in my ears, based on my extremely high experience. The game's music is also top-notch, with each scene's background music fitting perfectly, leaving a deep impression on me, especially the music during the Yellow Browed Battle and the rowing before the Great Sage's remains.  Lastly, the visuals, which might actually be the most outstanding aspect of this work. The entire game scene is designed exceptionally well, with Turtle Island, the Pagoda of the Buddha's Bone, Mei Mountain, Zhaojian Lake, the Great Sage's memory of the sunset, and even the interaction with falling leaves. Even if it's just for the scenery, this is an extremely excellent work.

Story is somewhat easy to follow given the amount of lore they provide. Love the skill tree respec available at any time, allowing for strategy changes for different bosses. Overall, a pretty solid game!    Some issues that I have with this game:  1) Invisible walls - invisible walls are very frustrating because it gives you a feeling that you have a big area to explore, only to be frustrated when you hit the wall. For crying out loud, there's even ledges that have invisible walls, only to find out later that you can explore the lower area! Either provide a skill that reduces fall damage, or design the map so that it actually shows the boundary of the area.    2) Graphical issues - 3070Ti is suffering with FSR, Very High Graphics. You can literally lose a boss fight from stuttering and frame drops.    3) Traversal - map traversal is so boring. Like, you have a monkey... that won't even swing around. I'm currently at chapter 3 and there doesn't seem to be any hint of that mechanic in the game. Even Jump doesn't have much use outside of combat, and when you do use it, it's so janky, and also, links back to the invisible walls issue. Sure, there's bits where you can transform into something, but it's not as fun as vine swinging (or web swinging as Spidey).    4) UI Design - generally, the UI is pretty solid. My issue is the item ""wheel"". There are drink names that doesn't align against their intended effect. You would think ""Evil Repelling Drink"" is some kind of holy negation drink right? WRONG! It's Physical Damage Negation buff! So... I hope they fix this by adding icons of the drink effect in the item wheel.",1785.0,2024-09-03 08:59:09,Recommended

0.5577049255371093,english,"[i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35145066/] My review page.[/url][/i]  [i][url=https://www.twitch.tv/nightserg] Follow me on twitch![/url][/i]  [h1]The gist of it:[/h1] Do be aware that the majority of the reviews for Wukong are from China, even those in English, and as such this review will probably trigger some. We live in a time where singleplayer games without any kind of bs such as pandering to the far left, microtransactions, and similar trash are rare, so rare that whenever a pure singleplayer game with a pretty hefty budget focuses on the right things releases, gamers will instantly love it and ignore all its faults. Black Myth Wukong is one of those games. I am not one of those gamers. Black Myth Wukong is an extremely average action-adventure game that heavily takes inspiration from games of its genre while not excelling at anything in particular.   👍 [u]The good parts:[/u] +Certain boss fights are pretty well-designed  👎[u]The bad parts:[/u] -One of the worst level designs I've ever encountered -Outside of boss fights, there is nothing good -Incredibly boring atmosphere  [h1]Story[/h1] The story is based on Journey to the West which is a very famous fictional novel in China. It's sadly not a very direct story, similar to God of War, but instead, they decided to go the obtuse route which makes it even worse as the novel itself was already incredibly difficult to follow.   Black Myth Wukong's story is more of a giant proverb that heavily focuses on the metaphorical morality of life which felt at odds with itself because, at certain times, it feels like it wanted to be a normal story, similar to God of War or any western media, but then decides to forget it and it starts going into nonstop proverbial dialogues irrelevant to the main story, if we can even call it a story.   This is more evident as each chapter has unique cinematics, which were very cool designed, that have a moral at the end, for example, there was this story where a guy finds a wounded fox in the mountains, takes it home to take care of it, it transforms into a beautiful woman and their life begins, however at the end, the woman was actually a demon and she devours his family, but then he wakes up back at the cabin. Realizing the dream was a sign, he kills the fox.   These small cinematics were great and the game would've benefited more if they relied on them throughout the chapters, for example being part of the guy's story and the final boss would be the fox demon. Sadly as it is, the story was just average, you have to collect artifacts to become the chosen one, the end. Perhaps for people living in China, it might be more nostalgic than anything else.   Story rating: 6.5/10  [h1]Gameplay[/h1] Wukong's gameplay isn't exactly fresh or new and sadly it didn't do anything good or fun up until the end. It copies core mechanics from God of War, Jedi Survivor, and From Software games and mixes them, a jack of all trades master of none.   You spam attacks at bosses with tons of health, dodge a few times and that is it. Out of the ""hundreds"" of bosses it has, I can count on one hand the ones that may have required some thinking or learning their attack patterns. A lot of people were dismissive of calling the game a boss rush, however, they are factually wrong because for starters, outside of boss fights, there is absolutely nothing good about the gameplay. The smaller enemies are some of the most boring and uninteresting-designed enemies you've ever faced and are just there to pad the game for no reason.   The looting and finding things aspect is average, as most of the good stuff drops from bosses. Sadly since each boss has more and more HP, you're forced to explore and look for mats to increase your damage output else you'll be spending an hour taking down their health. I've never felt a sense of awe or ""wow look at this epic thing I found"" once in the entire game, though I have to give them credit for turning a simple game into a weak RPG as an afterthought. Yes, the game has skill points as you'd expect, and yes most of them are useless.  Moving on from the mid aspects of the game, the boss fights is what most people are in for. I say boss fights, but I consider them the average enemy in this game and only a few are actual boss fights. These boss fights are average towards ok. You'll never face anything as terrifying as the likes of Souls games or as amazingly cinematic as the likes of God of War games. To make matters worse, they're all HP sponges, and outside of using a few skills and dodging you're just hitting a wall with your stick.   Gameplay rating: 7/10  [h1]Audio[/h1] Overall the audio design is decent, I played it with Chinese voice acting and I had no problems with it at all, they all performed quite well. The soundtrack is pretty good, nothing really memorable, but it does a decent job of making the boss fights less boring.   As for the rest of the sound effects, nothing really good or bad to say about them. I never felt the environments being alive which would be a minus, but then again, I have a lot of negative things to say about the atmosphere of the game below.   Audio rating: 7.5/10  [h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1] The game uses Unreal Engine 5 and as such expect horrible performance if you don't use DLSS or frame generation, expect heavy stutters when the game loads new assets such as boss skills. The worst offenders are the atmosphere and level design.   For starters, the game as I mentioned is based on a fantastic fictional novel Journey to the West. If you've seen movies based on it, you might remember some very nice locations and architectural designs. The game has none of that. Instead, you'll be exploring forests and caves that you've seen a million times or outside of your house with a few Buddhist statues and temples copy-pasted for lore reasons. I'm not even joking, watch a walkthrough, that's all you'll ever be in, forests, whether it's dead ones, lush ones, or snowy ones.   The second worst offender is the level design. It makes absolutely no sense. If you've played any Dark Souls game you'll know each road you take is masterfully inter-connected to one another, the whole map is a giant playground. Wukong has its main zones split by loadings so they're not connected to one or the other. Furthermore, each zone has multiple paths that lead to nowhere or minibosses making exploration incredibly tedious.   The last offender is the input, specifically the reading of it. It's incredibly delayed, certain skills take forever for Wukong to use, for example, you'll have to spam drinks in order for him to actually start drinking them and the same goes for the skills. To make matters worse, certain skills take forever to cast and enemies just attack non-stop which will cancel your skills and put them on cooldown. Sometimes they bugged. It's a mess.   Most people will look at the game and say ""Wow look at those graphics, look at those tree leaves flying around you"" and that's all just generic UE5 assets. Everything about the environments felt soulless, like someone generated using ""AI"". Compared to Dark Souls, a game that came out decades ago which on a technical level wasn't that great, Wukong looks incredibly uninspired and would've benefited more if they focused on art rather than pretty trees.   Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 5/10  [h1]Conclusion[/h1] I don't think anyones going to even notice this review, since 90% of the reviews are just blindly praising the game and ignoring its faults, but I advise against purchasing it at full price.

0.5519821047782897,english,"[h1]Black Myth Wukong: A Completionist's* Review[/h1] A peak of 2 million players and 140k positive reviews all on the first day of release. There’s a lot of sentimentality influencing the positive reviews, so how good is the game really? Here’s my review after completing the game with all endings, and beating all 81 bosses in the span of 45 hours of gameplay.  [h2]Story[/h2] The story of Black Myth takes place after the events of the 15th century novel Journey to the West, and contrary to popular belief, you don’t actually play as the titular Sun Wukong, but a monkey known as “The Destined One”.  So I’ve got good news and bad news in that department. The bad news is that a lot of Black Myth’s story references the novel and features many of its characters. As someone with only rudimentary knowledge of the novel, parts of the story were somewhat confusing to me. It also did not help that the game also features a number of Buddhist jargon.  However, the good news is that I don’t think one needs to understand the finer details to appreciate the overall story, because the gist of your mission is easy enough to understand. I also see the story as a somewhat of an anthology because it features many different tales told via stunning animations and raw emotions that anyone can appreciate and feel regardless of language or foreknowledge of the novel.  [h2]Gameplay/Combat[/h2] Combat in this game is actually fairly straightforward. Your primary weapon is a staff, and there’s a single light attack combo and 5 different heavy attacks depending on how much “focus” you have. These attacks can have several added variations to them depending on various skills and stances. And as you progress through the game, you gain access to many more different spells and abilities, which can provide a good amount of variety.  IMO, the main strength of combat comes from enemy design. Enemies don’t just look incredibly original and cool; they also have some of the best attack sequences I’ve ever seen. Boss fights are something like dance battles of sorts; you watch attack patterns, learn to dodge accordingly, and unleash your attack combos when you find openings.  I found overall combat to be very smooth and satisfying and could not identify any major flaws with it at all.  [h2]Exploration[/h2] Black Myth is advertised as being a linear experience, and that’s true in the sense that it isn’t an open world game. But the zones in the game can get MASSIVE.   Have you ever played an open world game and decided to go exploring off the beaten track to see if you could find some loot, only to just end up in dead ends with nothing? In Black Myth, the game rewards your explorative efforts with various loot, unique monsters, cutscenes, new abilities, secret bosses, and sometimes just straight up entirely new secret zones. Basically, if you think there is something in a certain direction, there probably is going to be something. There is so much optional content in this game that I’d say it makes up more than half the entire experience.  And for those worried about the game becoming a tedious walking simulator, fret not, because this game has plenty of shrines peppered around the map that serve as fast travel points, ensuring that exploration never really feels like a slog.  However, there are a number of flaws in this department.   For one, the game does not make it visually clear where you can and cannot explore. Some obstacles you can jump over, and others are just blocked by invisible walls. This can get pretty jarring and mildly annoying at times, but at least the game doesn’t punish you by making you travel down long paths only to hit invisible walls.   The second complaint that many have is the absence of a map. As zones can get pretty large, it can be easy to get lost if you don’t have the best sense of direction. Personally, I think I understand the creative decision not to include a map, because it does hit differently when you explore and discover secret areas on your own, as opposed to constantly opening a map to see where you’re going. I found that the game did train me to find my bearings by way of identifying landmarks, kind of like the old days without GPS.  I enjoyed the sense of discovery in this game, but it definitely would’ve been nice if Game Science added a “Guiding Wind” function like Ghost of Tsushima to provide players with some directional guidance.  [h2]Difficulty[/h2] Many have said this is the hardest game they’ve ever played, while others have found the difficulty manageable. Personally, I don’t consider this game THAT difficult because of the following: -	There are almost no insta-death mechanics -	You have access to a healing flask that can be used and upgraded multiple times -	You can use temporary stat boosting supplements -	You don’t need to perform perfect dodges and mistakes are forgivable -	There is no lengthy test of concentration -	Bosses can get challenging, but are never really “cheap”  Personally, I consider Black Myth to be challenging, but not a “difficult” game, and would rate it 7/10 in terms of difficulty. With patience and perseverance, I believe almost anyone can beat this game.   [h2]Visuals and artistic direction[/h2] I’ve played a lot of visually stunning games: TW3, RDR2 etc. And IMO, Black Myth is second to none in terms of its visuals and artistic direction. From the beautiful backdrops, detailed and culturally rich architecture, gorgeous lighting, particle physics, I just keep mouthing “holy sh*t” every time I explored somewhere new. Also, you are rewarded with beautifully directed animations at the conclusion of every chapter. I don’t even know how to properly describe what Game Science has done in this video game because it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. Every chapter just kept blowing me away and I think Black Myth is a true landmark in video games as an art form.  [h2]Flexibility[/h2] I felt that the flexibility deserves a section of its own because of how well Black Myth does it. Ever played games with fast travel and skill trees? Notice how when you want to fast travel or reset skill points, you need materials or money to do so? Well this game has none of that nonsense. You can fast travel from anywhere and reallocate skill points at no cost whatsoever. This takes away that common concern about having the “perfect build” because you can experiment freely. The game also packs half its content in optional content, so those in a rush can simply just play the main content and be done with the game in under 25hrs.  [h2]Performance[/h2] [b]My specs:[/b] CPU: R7 5700X GPU: RX 7900 GRE RAM: 16gb 3066mhz x2 Display: 1440p 165mhz  Personally, I could get 80-100 FPS on max settings with almost no frame drops for 99% of the game. I found optimisation in this game to be exceptional, but it seems that those with higher end rigs may encounter issues, so be sure to be sure to do research accordingly.  [h1]Black Myth Wukong does not meet expectations; it far exceeds it[/h1] I was one of the many skeptics of this game, expecting either a disappointing flop at worst, or a fancy looking linear boss rush at best. Yes, this game is far from perfect and is definitely rough around the edges, but there is so much right that I don’t think the cons detract much from the experience at all.  Game Science has managed to accomplish something I never could’ve considered to be even possible, and delivered a memorable AAA experience that I would unreservedly consider to be the current leading contender for Game of the Year.",7564.0,2024-09-01 01:02:51,Recommended
0.5513021945953369,english,"A monkey reaps what he sows... That's one of life's immortal truths that are so true that I almost find them funny.    If I had learned anything from this game, it is that you should never say no to a story.     This is an eye-opener game. This is grand and this is epic. Such greatness and excellence. Characters, music, the world, and its stories.    Journey to the West is the kind of tale that moves the mountains and buries the sun.    Never did I experience such an ambitious, incredible, and jaw-dropping adventure. It's so touching that I cannot help but feel like a piece of me is missing now that I finished the game.        The stakes are heaven and earth themselves but also are nothing more than you, than me, an individual, and their inner spirit. They are global and far-reaching, yet so private.    On a chessboard where the the pieces are the players, and the players are ever perplexed whether they are destiny's pawns or each is the result of their own doing.     Are we mere instruments for the Celestial court, for those high above? or are we truly a monkey reaps what he sows?    This journey is so magnificent and well-written that it makes you wish to be Chinese. That you were there in the 1600s. That you were with the journeyers, for I wished that... and since wishes aren't horses, to that end, I bid all of you farewell at this moment, for our journey is unfinished and we shall all meet in the novel.",1430.0,2024-09-22 23:53:23,Recommended
0.5512820482254028,english,"Wukong is phenomenal. That's it. Now you can go and play it.  Who would've thought that a game that came practically out of nowhere and many people were doubting would even be real would be so good?   First of all, I just want to mention that my current play time allowed me to finish Wukong with majority of its side content. I may not have killed all the bosses and missed two things here and there, but overall I managed to beat every secret and unlocked the true ending.  Nearly everything about this game is fantastic. The bosses are varied and there is no repetition, with the exception of one or two bosses. But that can be forgiven with its vast menagerie of 107 bosses overall. The graphics are simply beautiful. The music - fantastic. You will know what I am saying especially when you get into the Chapter 2. The story is not complicated, but it is beautifully told through the mixture of in-game cutscenes and hand-drawn interludes. It will definitely make you engaged!  But the most important thing is that in my opinion Black Myth: Wukong, like no other game, has nearly perfect power progression. You start weak and as nothing - and at the end of the game you truly feel the power that was gained through the entire journey. I cannot overstate how amazing the feeling is, especially in the ending scenes of the True ending. Yes, in every game you start as a weak character and build upon it but in here it is just done perfectly. In the end, you will feel that it was all worth it.  On the neutral side - the game is not an open world. For me personally, I am exhausted with every game taking 100 hours to beat minimum and I welcomed this change of pace. Wukong can be comfortably beat in 25-35 hours as you can see, even if you want to explore every nook and cranny.  I have heard many times people comparing Wukong to Souls, but there is not that much that they have in common. Yes, there is stamina, there are gourds (estus, but imo improved in every way) and the enemies respawn upon resting. That's it. That's the entirety of the Soul content in Wukong. The game is probably a bit more difficult than God of War, but both people who want to have more of a casual challenge and be pushed a lot will find something in this game. Wukong can be customized in a lot of ways, so everybody will find a more or less powerful playstyle for themselves.   Oh, and I'd also forget - the quality of life in this game is insane. Forget being forced to play one build and not being able to respec; if you change your mind, at any time about your decisions in Wukong, you can amend them freely. I cannot state enough how refreshing that is.  Now, there are some problems with the game. Personally, Chapter 3 has been a slog. It introduced one of the most ridiculously annoying mechanic that I have seen in video games in a long time and the story of it was forgettable. The mechanic can be quickly dealt with (unfortunately probably you will look for a guide that tells you how), and once the chapter is over the story quickly picks up again.  The optimization is also not perfect. But, as always, it's a bit of Nvidia's broken promises that with a sufficient graphics card you can play a title with Raytracing. For me, on RTX 3080 with 12GB VRAM I was only able to have smooth, capped 60 FPS without the ray tracing. Even on low the game was stuttering, unbearably.  But, those two reasons are not enough for me to to not recommend this game.   In fact, Wukong is a must play if you like God Of War like games.",3515.0,2024-09-08 07:02:07,Recommended

Loads of hidden areas, numerous viable builds, and spectacularly beautiful animation.

Each encounter feels epic, with boss fights that are both visually spectacular and mechanically engaging, requiring players to think tactically rather than rely on brute force.  Narratively, ""Black Myth: Wukong"" promises an intriguing and mysterious story, drawing on rich Chinese folklore. The game does a fantastic job of balancing its mythological roots with fresh, creative interpretations of legendary creatures and figures.

0.5505476593971252,english,"[h1] Black Myth: Wukong – A Gorgeous, Glorious, Occasionally Infuriating Odyssey[/h1] Let’s get one thing straight right away: I loved this game. I’ve played it twice, unlocked every achievement, and poured hours into its mythical madness.  Black Myth: Wukong is a bold and beautiful that punches above its weight with an eye for spectacle, lore, and stylish combat. But, like Wukong himself, it’s a bit... unruly. Beneath the divine aesthetics and exhilarating boss fights lies a game that occasionally tests your patience in ways that aren’t always intentional. Still, if you're a fan of myth, challenge, and monkey kung-fu, this is one journey you won't regret taking.  [h2]Visual : Myth in Motion[/h2] Graphically, Wukong is a visual masterpiece. From haunted forests to crumbling temples to cinematic boss arenas, the environments are lush, dramatic, and just plain pretty to look at. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3321051120 Cutscenes? Absolute dopamine grenades. Beautifully directed, like you're watching the trailer for a movie you wish existed. It’s almost annoying how good they are.  [h2]Combat: Kung-Fu  Chaos[/h2] Combat starts strong. Real strong. That early-game boss who beat me like a drum? Iconic. Wukong delivers a fluid, dodge-heavy system where you swap weapons, deploy flashy spells, summon monkey clones, and feel like an absolute menace , when the mechanics behave.  The game rewards timing and precision, especially early on, with fights that demand focus and finesse. But after Chapter 3, things get a bit too breezy. Healing items become abundant, stamina turns into a vague suggestion, and even terrifying bosses start falling over like they forgot how to hit back.  There’s great combat depth, but not enough late-game enemies that demand you use it. It’s like the game trains you for the Olympics, then hands you a tricycle. This game throws you into fast-paced, punishing encounters that demand timing, patience, and probably a new controller. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3325594369 [h2]Mechanics & Clarity:[/h2] It has a great core combat system, fluid dodging, flashy transformations, and a solid arsenal of spells and skills.

0.5478045940399169,english,"❗Unrelated Rant Incoming❗    I absolutely hate Dune (2021). I absolutely hate everything it represents. I hate the cast, I hate how overhyped it is, I hate how boring the movie actually turned out to be; but most of all, I DESPISE the people that say that you have to had read the books in order to grasp and comprehend the movie. As if my opinion is somehow less valid for not partaking in complimentary activities about the media I am consuming. As if it wasn't fair to expect that a piece of art should be able to stand on its own. I think that is complete dog shit. Personally, I have never been able to finish reading a complete book, let alone a 1000 page book like Dune (I have a broken sense of attention like most of us do today). So to me, when someone manifests to my face a finger-waggy, ""morally superior"", mounted-on-a-high--white-stallion, holier than thou READ THE BOOK FIRST OR ELSE opinion, I kinda lose my shit. The movie sucks bro. The characters are super bland, the events feel unimportant, the performances are weak (the photo is pretty good though). You can't expect me to excuse it being trash under the excuse that reading the book will suddenly make it amazing. The OG Lord of the Rings didn't have that problem. Neither did Fightclub, neither did No Country for Old Men (and many more examples). Thankfully though, neither does Black Myth: Wukong.    I am a huge believer that if something is actually good, you don't need to understand the innerworkings of it to experience and identify that it is good. Think of a great meal you had recently - or better yet, think of a great song you heard. Think of the intense feelings it gave you. Bask in the meadows of multicolored worlds that it allowed you to travel. Think of how it made you remember that one time when your mom picked you up from school and took you to McDonalds. It feels good doesn't it? At worst, it FEELS. It makes you feel things. The mere existence of it makes you understand that you are in awe and you feel a towering presence looming over you. This is how good art feels. Whether its food or music or a videogame. You don't need to understand how its cooked, how its composed or in this case; you don't need to read a 3000 page book to witness what a great game Black Myth is.    Rant aside, this is a game that is based on a very old chinese novel, a Journey to the West. The novel is hugely influential since it served as inspiration to birth many of todays most beloved characters (Goku from DBZ and Luffy from One Piece for example). Something that you definitely don't have to know to enjoy the game, although (despite my rant before) it does add some context for the aesthetics and a lot of context for the story. It's very refreshing to play a game that feels so good in its mechanics, but that is also not a western game. I feel like sometimes chinese games have the stigma that they are going to be cheap or mobile game-like, but in reality I found that this game plays a lot like a very polished bloodborne.    I always enjoyed games that are submerged in mythological lore and to me the chinese myth lore has always been extremely deep and vast. There are many archetypes that are portrayed beautifully in the game and the many characters that appear in it. It always brought a smile to my face to witness the cartoon like joy and naiveté of certain characters during the adventure. I feel like games that are rooted in ancestral stories are always bound to feel very related, especially when they're done in an artsy way and when other videogame elements like combat mechanics and progression don't stand in the way of it.    The combat, like I mentioned before, reminds me somewhat of bloodborne. (Think of a bloodborne and devil may cry blend) There is a lot of dodging and a lot of fast paced mechanics. The destined one (which I forgot to mention is our silent hero in this case), carries a huge assortment of spells and maneuvers that never make the combat feel stale. You can also turn into many types of Yao Guais (how the mobs are referred to in this game) you defeat and capture along the way, allowing people that really like to switch up the gameplay, have a new set of tools to try every so often. The variety of bosses and mobs in this game is just astounding. I wouldn't fault you if you thought that this game was more of a boss rush at first, just due to the fact of the sheer amount of bosses you get to fight as soon as the game starts.    This is no dark souls though. Most bosses, even when looking and moving in a very intimidating way, weren't extremely difficult to defeat. I was able to tear through most (Fuck you Erlang) of them in one or two tries. Sometimes three. Thankfully I think this is a really good plus for the game. Having many bosses that are beatable and feel fair really gives the player a strong dopamine boost to keep playing. The game also rewards you a lot with items to craft armor and weapons fairly consistently and I mention this because everything looks really beautiful. I mean, I know that ""receiving materials for crafting"" sounds possibly incredibly boring or mundane, but in this game it always feels like it's something you earned - and I am not sure if it was because the game was made in unreal engine 5, but EVERYTHING looks beautiful. The feedback for getting items. The bosses, the environments. Really pristine - and honestly It only hits so hard because the game is really good. Looking good on its own rarely does good things.    Now, I kinda get why the devs did this, but I actually do not understand at all the lack of a map in this game. Despite it not being an open world game, you get lost ALOT. Sometimes you want to advance a sidequest or you're exploring part of the map and suddenly you unknowingly advance the main story and get thrown out of the area. Part of the reason this is hard to deal with is because the story is very dense and very hard to follow. You need sometime to unpack the things that happen or maybe follow sidequests to distract yourself from the main thing. I found myself constantly being betrayed by my muscle memory only to realize I had paused the game looking for a map for the 100th time. I know many games do this too, but if you play it, you will see how easily you will get lost. It's not a great feeling.    After many hours and many many many boss fights, there's a section at the end of the game where the map opens up a bit more and you get to fly on top of a cloud like Goku - and that's pretty fucking awesome.    I know I always complain that reviewing really long games is hard for me - and this game is no exception. There's always a lot to say and unpack especially if the game inspires me to talk about different themes that contain more things than just the game. Sometimes it feels overwhelming and this game is truly an overwhelming game. You have to take the time and play it over several weeks to really immerse yourself in this world and the story. One that is truly worth it and will leave you marked with the archetypes that us humans have kept alive by telling stories over many generations. Stories that have reached our modern day and are told in such a way that bring us value and tools for effective introspection.    Thank you if you reached this part of my review. It was really cathartic to write and If you are on the fence about this game, I really hope you give it a shot.

0.5454545617103576,english,"Black Myth: Wukong has been an amazing journey! I enjoyed the gameplay, sound design, music, characters, and the fantastic world-building as well as the many references to the books too. One of my favorite features are the incredible music videos that play after finishing each chapter, adding a unique touch to the experience before laying the chapter to rest. Even the enemy AI was quite impressive and stuck the most with me with the animations. Though the English dub was not synced properly with the lips of speaking characters which makes me recommend the amazing Chinese Dub of the game.  While there were a few minor issues, they’re mostly nit-picky. For instance, I found that some paths lacked clarity. I like to complete all side objectives before progressing the main story/path, but more than once, I accidentally stumbled onto the main path. Maybe I missed a subtle hint or something that was explained inside the game itself, but it was frustrating to unexpectedly trigger a boss fight and then be forced into the next chapter. Unfortunately, once this happens, there’s no way to go back without starting the new chapter and using the shrine to return to the previous Chapter.  Aside from that small nit-pick, Black Myth: Wukong is undoubtedly my game of the year. It’s a must-play for anyone who enjoys action-packed, immersive gaming experiences as well as the fans that enjoyed the books and many forms medias adapted from it such as Dragon Ball and etc!",1472.0,2024-09-22 19:07:42,Recommended

0.5454545617103576,english,"Black Myth Wukong return to monkey is an action pack rpg akin to god of war with a pinch of soul mechanics sprinkled in. The world is gorgeously detailed with a multitude of biomes. From lush green forests, to dry sandy deserts, sparkling snow, each filled with Buddhist iconography. Temples temples temples you will see eye popping temples devoutly crafted to the smallest detail, I can feel the Buddha watch over me as my monkey cheeks gets clapped by the next monstrous abomination.   As you progress further into the game many of Wukong’s legendary abilities are earned through a multitude of challenges and secrets. Secrets you might ask? Yes secrets, this game has secrets scattered in like a Bob Ross scattering happy little trees into his painting. Now we are going into a con with the game. The levels are beautiful, but they are linear with constant invisible walls blocking your movement. As a matter of fact there is an unstuck button within your menu that you can use to get yourself out, if you are stuck between an asset such as a tree and an invisible wall. Unfortunately my monkey was in that same situation, but with the added bonus within a boss arena. So my poor monkey had to take the pounding. As you journey throughout the map you start to question whether a path you can take or an invisible wall. This will cause a player to miss a significant portion of secret locations or quests they can take on. That is the only major con to me as a player, other than that, I will continue to gush over the game.   Such as the BOSSES. Oh yes, the bosses have so much variety. From slippery adversaries trying to smack me side to side. To slow moving bruisers with a single hit sending me to home run. Out of all the bosses only one boss has one unfair mechanic, where you are forced to take damage. The combat is standard press light attack, press heavy attack when opening, dodge, and use spells depending on your resource bar. There are no combos like light light heavy or heavy light light etc. It is more bare bones, but very polished, each perfect dodge a sound will pop indicating you dodged at the last possible second. Truly a neuron activation moment.   Your efforts throughout the game will be dutifully rewarded with beautiful animation cut scenes at the end of each chapter. Black Myth Wukong is something done so well with so much passion from the developers you can feel their excitement for the source material with every sight and sound.

Ever since Sekiro, I have been looking for a game that is challenging with satisfying combat experiences. Elden Ring was fun but the combat is just not as interactive and satisfying as Sekiro. And now with Black Myth: Wukong, I have finally found another game that gives such satisfying combat experiences. I would even say this game actually excels Sekiro in some aspects. I love how fast-paced the combats are, and being aggressive is actually beneficial just like Sekiro. In addition, the fact there are so many spells, spirits, transformations, stances, equipment skills available adds variety to the combat experiences. There are so many different playstyle or build to choose from and you can change your build any time. Even at my fifth playthrough, I am still discovering new ways to play the game. My favorite thing to do is to switch stances mid-battle and see-through counter with different varied combos (so satisfying when pulling it off). On top of the move variety, no two bosses are the same and every fight is just incredibly cinematic.       For people looking to start souls-like games, I would recommend starting with this one. This game is much more forgiving and easy to get into compared to actual souls games. You don't lose anything on death, you can refund and respec skill points any time you want, you have a much stronger dodge that enables dodging at last second before you get hit, and you can farm levels if you are having trouble with a boss.

The game excels at nearly everything it attempts, from storytelling and presentation to graphics, score, and combat—everything is top-notch. There are a few drawbacks, such as the excessive use of invisible walls that detract from immersion and some frustrating RNG-based trophies (I checked them today to see if going for 100% was worth it, and I was disappointed.

0.9756830930709838,schinese,几年前当我第一次听到黑猴的第一只预告片的时候，那时候的黑猴简直像病毒一样破圈的传播。我当时是很不屑一顾的，我像对待各种大热的东西一样有思维定式：“昙花一现”“大热必死”“营销手段”罢了。但是我按耐不住好奇心，打开了第一只预告片。从鄙视到疑惑再到惊叹，我在诧异这真的是真实的游戏画面吗？不会像类似扎尔伯克元宇宙预告片那种纯靠造假骗人消费的玩意吧。但愿不是。又过了很久，当那个发布日期确定的预告片出来以后，我的各种群又多了很多很多关于黑猴的讨论，我迫不及待的打开了那个史诗一般的预告片。我依然记得我当时看的热泪盈眶，回想了一下应该是预告片里震撼的画面和命运般的背景音乐还有民族自豪感共同作用的结果。我发现我从未对一款未上架的游戏如此期待，我期待黑猴横空出世，但我也害怕像网上说的那样发售即褒姒。8月20日前的每一天都是猴急猴急的。 一直到我真正的玩上了黑猴。     我预购了豪华款，横竖我都要支持一下这款国产的3A大作。而且我也不差钱（不是，黑猴本身国区定价就不高而且STEAM倒倒余额真没多少钱。）而且我在看B站直播的时候还中了一份普通版黑猴（真天命人本人）。我还推荐给了我的朋友们，推荐给那些有PS5有配置够用电脑的伙伴们。虽然他们有的到现在还只过了广智，但是他们过了序章也明白了我为什么这么期待这款游戏。 黑猴，我自己打了5个轮回，我用过网上发现的BUG，下过某幸修改器，学过逃课打法，详细搞明白了识破机制，找了个10周目的存档打过了杨戬和大圣残躯，从最开始我被幽魂折磨到甚至怀疑这游戏到底适不适合我、想起当初游科他们采访时候说游戏不难到底算不算虚假宣传、到最后也用了几十小时无伤过了虎先锋、寅虎、甚至是十周目的小黄龙。按朋友的话，现在去第几章哪个图我现在就跟回家一样。     游戏好玩吗？好玩，好玩的背后我觉得更厉害的是不同认知的人能从这个作品都能找到自己独特的收获。     手活好的玩家可以用三种棍法，打出无比华丽的无伤视频。（到底是发明的无伤视频啊，看着爽打着更舒爽呵呵）善于利用机制的玩家，发明各种搞笑无脑的轮椅打法。禁字决更像魂类玩法，召唤流，放毒流，减伤流，隐身流，双风控制流等等各种BD，天命人的成长最快止步于3周目结束，但是怪的数值会涨到6周目。黑猴的套装做的非常华美，虽然给人一种成长不明显的感觉。     喜欢听国风音乐的玩家，能把这个游戏的音乐列表循环播放。说几个我印象最深的，序章的鼓让人瞬间进入紧张的状态、打广智教头时候的BGM《大闹黑风山》让我想起了很古早的另一款国产游戏《流星蝴蝶剑》第二关钟乳洞。虎先锋《猴头好下酒》中国鼓和琵琶的魅力一览无余。小骊龙音游《砂掩骊鬓》，玩的时候我整个人都要高潮了。八戒相关的BGM我更喜欢《勿听》不太喜欢《戒网》，我觉得《戒网》里的男声音色不太抓我耳朵。这样的例子还有很多，充满命运感的小黄龙《善恶若无报》，破圈的《我也去当个天命人玩玩》等等。我认同网上某些音乐人的一些看法，在游戏BGM里用人声主旋律是一种非常大胆的做法。做好了，这个旋律你根本忘不掉。比如第二章的陕北调子《黄风起兮》第三章过场动画的《屁》。用不好，可能会喧宾夺主影响你的游戏体验。最后两章的音乐可能确实没有前4章做的那么好，最后大圣残躯那里的BGM确实没有那么丰满，但其实那里的BGM个人感觉更多是给看过86西游玩家的礼物，当你这个天命人直面大圣的时候，有回忆有感动有属于国人自己的浪漫。整个游戏总体上BGM用了大量的大调，听起来非常神圣、大气充满史诗给人一种热血沸腾的感觉。 摄影爱好者更是开心了，游戏画面的考究，细节多到玩久了显卡会过热。更是给山西省泼天的流量，整的山西人都没法午睡了。我朋友最近去山西玩还给我带回一套通关文牒，真是梦幻联动。     游戏剧情是网上分歧最大的部分，有人认为游戏有诸多采用原著的各种细节设定，但是大圣的设定，神佛的设定是与原著背道而驰的。有人甚至给黑猴扣上对西游文化乃至中国传统文化破坏巨大的帽子。我只能说这种乱扣帽子人才是最阻碍中国传统文化发展的人。就连我6岁的女儿都知道这是黑神话，这不是原著，当然不能什么都拿来套原著。原著西游记能作为我国古代四大名著之一，自然是因为有其独特的价值所在的。有足够文笔的人没有吴承恩这一生与官场复杂的经历，有足够经历的没有吴承恩的写作能力。但是西游记是完美的吗？自然也不是。西游记也有它本身时代的局限性，讲的故事毕竟还是封建王朝的故事。所以我认为黑猴更高明的地方正是在讲革命的故事。什么革命？无产阶级站起来的革命！王侯将相宁有种乎！如果你把黑猴里那些所谓的神佛带入现在的某灯国，某阶级我觉得就很好理解了。你不听神佛的，神佛就给你降苦难。你不定期上供灵韵，那就别怪我把你们全变成老鼠了哦。想想某些老外某些宗教眼中的我们，你说他的优越性来自于哪呢？自然他们把我们当成妖精了啊，自然会觉得高人一等。但是我们黑猴里的大圣是怎么一个存在呢？他跳脱出了自身的阶级，他不认可神佛人妖有贵贱之分，这点和黄眉口中金蝉子（即唐僧）观点一致，即万物皆有慧根。那么如果剧情只是简单的舍生取义呢？那就是网文水平了，大圣要我们天命人做的是，继承他的六根尤其是他的意志。     所以我来总结一下就是：                           不必时时怀念我，也不要指望我回来。我走之后，你们就是我。          所以如果这么看剧情，是完整的吗？其实是完整的，革命的火苗如果在每一个玩家心中种下，那星星之火可以燎原。当然，你说通过玩一个游戏就怎样怎样确实太高看游戏的影响力了。但是如果能让有的玩家有了这一点点想法，多去看一些教员的相关资料就是成功。好，那么再回头看黑猴里大圣的设定，他其实是立体的，是有成长过程的，他也是有七情六欲的，但是他为了更重要的追求他选择放弃儿女情长，与曾经的兄弟反目成仇等等。但是当他发现他最后取到的经，并不是真正能解决世间疾苦的时候，他并没有继续和神佛们同流合污。他选择哪怕以死的方式也要摆脱神佛的控制，这种反叛精神，这种革命者的精神不正是对原著孙悟空精神的继承吗？   可能是我想的太多了，这么社会主义的剧情如果太赤裸在西方社会自然是没有市场的。所以黑猴埋的深了一点，隐晦了一点导致网上分歧比较大。当然，有的人黑这款游戏确实是利益相关的。黑神话的成功能让他们破防成那样，我是没想到的。破百万测评里96%的好评看不到，拿着几百个串子跑别的地方刷的差评来安慰自己，又精神胜利了。   黑猴里的猪八戒真的是该游戏最成功的创作，说最傲娇的话做最蠢萌最仁义的二叔。八戒的故事线非常感人，八戒到最后也是俗人一个，但正是他俗让人觉得他更亲切更真实。 所以，如果你在游戏性、音乐、画面、剧情各种小细节小彩蛋上都有足够的收获，那么黑猴真的是一场盛宴！     黑猴的各种梗破圈很厉害，老外学起来也挺快。TGA年度最佳难道不就是一件锦襕袈裟吗？       最后的最后，谈谈游戏的不足。游戏性吗，后两章的粪怪一下多了起来，刚开始打的时候会有点容易让人红温。空气墙对我来说不算什么扣分项，BUG确实不少，我自己也遇到过一些，问题不大。后两章可能确实有点赶工了，设计没有前面那么的精彩。游戏UI要是有更多方便操作猴戏的存储点就好了，希望能出BOSS挑战模式。对战大目标时候的视角问题确实是让人不太舒服。(果然出了，爽！）     瑕不掩瑜，这是我玩的最久的单机游戏。也是最美好的回忆。希望游科有钱了，在未来创作上戒骄戒躁继续发力。我可以等，不要让我们失望。希望我们的国产游戏越来越好。  TGA最后还是证明了自己是个野鸡奖，你们媒体啊还是要提高知识水平，不要总想搞个大新闻。杨奇，你现在知道中指要向哪里竖了吧？,3159.0,2024-09-27 15:41:34,Recommended

0.9500863552093504,schinese,"本篇评测将从玩家角度对现阶段的《黑神话：悟空》[strike] （以下简称黑猴） [/strike]进行优缺点上的总结与评价。  [h2] 先上总体评价： [/h2] 黑猴从立项到游戏正式发售总共用时6年半，在首支实机视频发布后截止至发售时间的4年里，黑猴一直饱受舆论争议，毕竟在此之前，国内没有一家游戏开发商会用3A标准去开发一款大型单机游戏，更别说国内单机动作游戏领域长期处于技术空白。说实话，作为一名玩家，抛开四大名著西游题材的情怀加成，还是挺期待这款游戏的诞生，当时国内大部分朴素玩家最乐观的看法就是只要黑猴能接近立项时期战神4，奥德赛，大表哥2，猛汉王的质量就算成功。就在这样缺乏相应开发经验与普遍悲观的舆论环境下，游戏科学在黑猴开发上可谓稳扎稳打，牵头建立古建筑模型库，去到全国各地对名胜古刹进行实景扫描，在尝试解决虚幻5引擎技术问题的同时将更多的文化元素融入到游戏内容之中，并对此不断迭代更新，甚至因为开发力及产能的不足，理智地砍掉了近乎一半的开发计划，不断打磨现有内容，最终向玩家交出了一份远超预期的，极有开创性的，挑动了独属于国人玩家文化情怀DNA的东方奇幻ARPG大作。在通关黑猴之后，我对此只有4个字的评价[h3] [b] “无敌！”“牛逼！” [/b] [/h3]  对于玩家而言，ARPG游戏的吸引力主要体现在玩法（即以动作为表现形式的战斗系统以及包含探索、升级，技能等一切角色活动的rpg元素），其次是游戏代入感（画面表现力，音乐音效，场景关卡设计，故事性等可以进一步提高玩家感官反馈的综合性体现），在黑猴发售之前，国外开发商对此类游戏形式的开发几乎达到了顶峰，例如高难代表的魂类游戏，画面张力拉满的暴力美学代表战神，主打华丽爽快的硬核动作代表鬼泣等。  在如此多优秀作品的影响下，黑猴不但没有单纯地去模仿借鉴，而是在吸收很多同类型游戏的游戏特质后，确立了自己的玩法风格，并做到推陈出新，打破了“动作”标签总是与硬核高难度关联的魔咒，并且增多可以进一步削减游戏难度的战斗、法术、法宝及其针对性的搭配方案，同时弱化了数值与难度的强关联，将难度的主要体现转移至boss设计本身，这简直可以说是”大胆地开创性尝试""，让玩家的体验真正意义上回归游戏本身，而非为了体现难度一味地让玩家坐牢。   黑猴核心玩法上的低门槛+流畅灵动的连招与打击反馈+多变的应对手段+紧凑的头目战boss战+极具观赏性和韵味战斗风格及动作设计，再有深层文化属性上的共鸣加成，一轮轮战斗就如同让人身处一场持续性的刺激风暴，大脑不断喷水，简直爽飞了。直至黑猴发售，市面上都没有这么一款爽感如此密集的arpg游戏，从这个角度看，黑猴的玩法确实是开创性的，并且动作设计达到了同类顶尖的水平。  除玩法之外，黑猴的代入感明显也在虚幻5和游科美术风格的加持下步入了一个新的殿堂，它以极高的画面精细度，几乎接近于真实的视觉表现力，影视级的过场演出配合相得益彰的音乐音效与制作精良的章末动画极大地加速了黑猴的传播。其他的不说，黑猴美术风格中富有文化底蕴的场景亦或建模，这种将部分故事性融入画面的意境叙述，至少让国内大部分玩家在精神层面爽到了，这种源于深层文化的爽感是其他同类游戏无法给予国内玩家的独特体验。  从玩法与代入感结合来看，黑猴做到了长板极长，其中极其突出的部分不说超过同行业的3A水准，但确实达到了行业顶峰，其中战斗系统，boss与角色设计，美术风格，音乐音效就尤为突出。从这个角度看，说黑猴是国内3A游戏的里程碑，填补了国内单机动作游戏的空白，它的确当之无愧。  当然，与之相对短板也很明显，游科团队保留有斗战神时期的项目开发经验，同时主创又是西游迷，整个主创团队的文学水平及艺术水平在线，美术设计在斗战神时期也是拿过美术设计奖项的，这些具有一定经验积累的开发方向在吸取很多3A级ARPG大作的特点后自然可以做的更好，但像是单机游戏地图场景设计，关卡设计，开放世界探索玩法等等方向的开发和成熟度就只能依靠一步一个脚印把经验积累上去才能补上自身短板，毕竟大型arpg融入东方奇幻独特的美术风格是没有任何参照先例的。除开这个原因，黑猴大场景地图的割裂感与后面几个章节的赶工痕迹也确实证明了游科在开发上的产出乏力，这种无奈是可以理解的。  怎么说呢，瑕瑕瑕瑕瑕不掩瑜吧只能说，至少黑猴六个章节以核心玩法为主的内容做到了尽善尽美，游科团队很早的发布会就表示过不会把步子迈得太大。力所能及的方向他们确实尽力而为了，所以其实作为玩家也没什么小瑕疵不能忍受的。当然，未来也希望游科在续作中能补上自己的短板，补上玩家的遗憾，真正让黑猴“成为”大圣。  评价到此为止，接下来对黑猴特别突出的优缺点进行一个玩家视角的具体分析。  [hr][/hr]  [h3] 1.优点 [/h3] ▲战斗系统：作为黑猴玩法核心之一，它继承了近些年arpg大作的精密动作感+法术、物品策略应对的模式，并在此基础上大幅扩展了法术与物品的玩法，加大了玩家在选择应对策略时的容错率。简单举个例子，在面对妖怪攻击动作时，玩家可以有棍势切手、闪避、身法、变身接近4种拥有无敌帧的规避手段，还能通过主动释放满蓄力重棍、破隐一击、定身法或安身法来破招，而轻棍可以流畅衔接大部分法术和物品，哪怕在面对boss时反应时间不够，依旧有足够的补救手段来避免血条被瞬间清空。  另外又有丹药提供多样增益，化身+法宝既能破招硬直，又可以补输出，这些东西结合灵动迅捷的动作打击，简洁高效的策略变换有效降低了游戏门槛，让战斗体验上升了不止一个层次。这里都不需要对各种流派和异常状态机制进行展开说明，仅仅是把常见于arpg游戏中构成战斗系统的基本元素拎出来，黑猴主打一个流畅新颖且操作上限极高的战斗体验就已经远超同类游戏。相信不止是arpg玩家，跟随黑猴破圈入坑的普通玩家在熟悉游戏玩法后一定也可以收获很好的游戏体验。  最后，说一个大部分国外玩家无法体会的点：一款西游题材的3A级大作，里里外外都是文化底蕴构成的细节，且不说那些极有意境与想象力的场景设计，单单是战斗系统对故事背景的还原和重塑，就足以令国内玩家的快感成倍增加，反正我是冲爆了。  ▲难易度：通常来讲带有“动作”标签的游戏都逃不过需要考验玩家反应、打击停顿或是动作迟滞、高难游戏设计这类有一定门槛要求的特质，哪怕有动作分级，哪怕是不同类型，诸如横版动作，动作冒险，动作角色扮演等大部分都是如此，这几乎成为了行业规则。而厂商在开发动作游戏时，降低门槛的设计一般是提供难度选择，这看上去很友好，但实际上游戏的门槛依旧存在，比如放弃难度设计的法环。  这其实也没法具体去讨论到底哪些元素是粪，毕竟动作游戏最初就是强调操作性的，这类3A动作游戏在经历多年的开发创新，游戏套路在惯性之下差不多都固化了，例如极限反应时间，变帧快慢刀，无序roll点或读指令的逆天boss设计，反正就一遍遍捶打折磨玩家的精神，直至玩家依靠肌肉记忆以及高强数值通关，当然更多的会是弃游。动作游戏在玩法上的设计似乎到了瓶颈，只能从玩法之外去丰富游戏性，但又很难在原有基础上有更好的突破，近些年相信很多arpg玩家都深有体会，最典型就是某黄昏和某树影，对比两者的前作，只看见些紧凑的内容堆叠，令人恐惧的ZZZQ以及无趣的数值，可谓实属遗憾。  黑猴似乎很好地从同行那边吸取了经验，在放弃难度设计的同时，采用反套路打破固化思维，直接摒弃动作游戏传统规则，把难点主要集中于个别boss的特色设计上，配合手感极佳的战斗系统，真正意义上降低了游戏门槛。前文总结过这一点，之所以单拎出来夸，是我认为抛开一切作为国人的文化滤镜，超低门槛与战斗系统的组合是黑猴全网迅速爆火（包括外网）的唯二主要因素。  事实证明，只要好玩够爽，没人管你是什么题材，讲没讲好故事，缝了什么又缝了多少，哪怕是arpg这种3A大作频出的类型同样可以打破文化壁垒和刻板印象。  ▲画面：黑猴能在全网病毒式传播的另一个因素，这个肯定不需要多说，现实渲染+顶级美术设计+实景扫描模型+虚幻五，什么叫影视级的风景如画啊？我直接一个战术后仰！ （哼哼！让老外尝尝第九艺术的真正视觉表现力。）  ▲除战斗之外的其他游戏内容：游戏之所以被称为第九艺术，就在于那些丰富了核心玩法之外的构成因子，即游戏深度与广度的综合性体现，前文部分列举过，就不再一一细说。  这方面内容黑猴做得比较好的地方有以等级装备、技能天赋等为主的rpg核心元素，简单易懂的主线流程以及通关动画，立体感很足的角色设计（包括部分boss），出色的音乐音效。  还有最最最最最重要的一点，游科在围绕紧凑的战斗节奏上，很好的将大部分内容融合在一起，并找到了其中的最大公约数，这是黑猴在整体体验感上高于其他同类游戏的主要原因。  ▲优化：没什么好说的，虚幻5的入门显卡1060都能60帧跑黑猴，除了糊点，其他纹理细节都还算可以接受，都这样了还要什么自行车？  优点分析结束，最后总结一下吧，黑猴是我认为大部分玩家都能凭借自身力量过关的arpg游戏，绝对不会压仓底，友好的难度平衡搭配平滑的成长曲线以及不会直接压到游戏玩法的数值设计，在保有挑战性的同时，只要探索完整张地图就可以让你拥有挑战关底boss的战斗力，哪怕从未接触过arpg的玩家，也可以在现有的内容里的找到适合自己的流派，并且从黑猴的技能设计上可以看出游科不反对逃课，比如棍花流，搅棍流，肉身流，毒师流，隐身嗑药流等等，就连硬实力担当二郎神都只有一根血条，游科真的非常希望玩家能好好享受游戏，而非是无意义坐大牢。  想想吧连不太像人战鹰女士都快通关了[strike] （与毒敌大王大战70回合酣畅淋漓） [/strike]，这游戏真的难吗？当你一路闯关，最终干翻二郎神，解锁真结局，那种爽感填满心头的感觉真没啥平替吧，法天象地激斗的震撼感，压迫力拉满却放了一地水的大圣，天命人最后击败大圣难以描述的传承感，相信许多玩家在首次通关后也会像我一样大呼[h1] “牛逼”。 [/h1]  [b] ★官方在最近的一次游戏更新里增加连战模式，各位友友快来酣畅淋漓的坐牢吧~ [/b]  有风灵月影宗兜底，没入的兄弟们放心入吧。  [h3] 2.缺点 [/h3] ▲地图设计与探索收集：我认为地图设计的缺点不是空气墙，没有小地图这些近来老生常谈的问题，而是主要集中在背景与场景的分界模糊，路径引导上的视觉效果不明显，大部分地图场景过于空导致探索过程无法提供有效正反馈这三点上。  先说第一点，每个章节的独立地图整体上看没啥问题，生态系统、地形转换没有明显的突兀感，但可能是因为游科没有以线性叙事为主的开放地图设计经验，也可能是过于在意地图美术风格的整体性，很多你以为是场景的地方，实际却是背景，反之亦然。没有明显的场景与背景的视觉分界，探索体验真的很糟糕，尤其是在地形复杂且设计有多层结构的盘丝洞，纵使我是老开放世界类游戏玩家，但在盘丝洞的探索过程中也多次重复迷路，真的感觉是坐大牢。  如果第一点是由于开发团队经验缺失那确实情有可原，可第二点完全就是有作业不抄或者没抄好的典型反面例子，开放商在设计开放地图的时候一般有两种方式来降低玩家探索复杂地形的难度，一是主动性的视觉引导，例如猛汉王的导虫，二是被动的视觉提醒，比如刺客信条的突出物路径，战神4的导航标记等等，除了接近土地庙的白光，黑猴在常态下选择的第二种方式，采用火光指引路线，但在复杂地形中，火光经常与背景融合到一起，实际上视觉效果的明显度几近于无。这两者综合起来几乎把探索的糟糕体验放大了数倍。  从许多游戏内容的设计上可以看出，游科是鼓励玩家探索地图的，毕竟在以线性叙事为主的游戏中这可以最大程度丰富内容。可惜由于游科工期紧、产量低，确实没办法兼顾整体上的内容质量，这就引出第三个缺点，很多地图场景宏大且广阔，但是与之匹配的内容太少，探索的收益与正反馈严重不足，加之前面提到的缺点，这部分游戏体验就显得很空。  唯一值得称道的是，在与化身相关的精魄收集上，体验不错，再配合影神图总体还是很好的。其他收集品如文玩，种子等除了内容相对少，只能说中规中矩。（收集需要时间成本不是常识吗？）  [strike] 最后，我认为这是目前黑猴的内容中最影响游戏体验的一个缺点。希望游科在后续优化中至少可以补个小地图，以方便很多没玩过arpg或者开放世界游戏的玩家。 [/strike] （游科已经补上小地图了。）  ▲故事性的展开：黑猴主线流程里的剧情大纲因为极高质量的动画及角色设计，总体上的感受还是比较好的，但还是存在一定的理解门槛。由于黑猴起到了文化传播的作用，我决定严肃讲一下这个问题。  故事简单明了才能讲好故事，这是众所周知的前提，就像是游戏开局，很明确告诉玩家你是谁，你要去哪里，你要做什么，而在故事开局之后，故事的碎片化变得严重起来，很多故事细节藏到了影神图里，游戏作为故事载体，当然可以融入到内容本身，但依旧如前文总结的一样，过于单一过于紧凑，没能在更多地方以直观的方式把故事性融入进去。在抛开文化滤镜，更多的玩家只能从其他渠道或是看各种剧情解析来了解故事，有较高理解成本（频繁阅读影神图）的游戏，往往在体验上也是很差劲。黑猴的文化传播，实际上是以游戏体验好、战斗内容角色设计丰富、画面特效好等为主进行传播的，而不是直接从故事本身入手，只能说任重而道远。  虽说如此，但黑猴确实开了个好头，游戏做得好玩，才能考虑丰富故事内容，至少游科在这一点上的先后顺序没错。  客观的说，也没法过多苛责，这依旧是游科工期紧，人手少，产能跟不上导致的。当然，故事性如何更好的匹配兼容3A大作的游戏内容，是需要慢慢摸索方式方法的，这算是目前比较遗憾的一个点。  （故事好坏如何，还得等看见完整故事轮廓，才能见分晓。在二创鼻祖西游记面前提二创，也未免太过搞笑。）  PS： 其他诸如关卡设计，地图内容不足（尤其是花果山），后期赶工痕迹明显，道具装备物品略显匮乏，打坐点场景设计水平下滑等等就不展开说了，因果都差不多。  [b] 每每想起高台远程粪怪、独木桥堵路粪怪、飞天粪怪、偷袭粪怪等一众粪怪兄弟在本大圣一路畅爽无比的闯关路上给我突然来一个寸止挑战，我就恨不得想给宫崎老贼来上一拳。 [/b]   最后，衷心的希望游科在开发续作的征途上勇往直前，越做越好。  也祝各位看官天天开心。  至此，评测完毕。",5884.0,2024-09-11 22:26:42,Recommended

0.9052082896232604,schinese,即使去掉所谓爱国滤镜，黑神话也是一部素质十分优秀的游戏。  美术、音乐、演出、文案都值得满分。战斗我给8.5分吧，几乎无预输入的手感太怪了，还有后期怪一些太明显的读指令和勾史碰撞体积明显欠打磨；不过也有不少交互感很强的boss设计要特别夸夸，尤其尾王我真是越打越喜欢。关卡设计7分，主次要路径区分太不明显了，基本没做软引导；这一缺陷在快活林尤其明显。RNG 0分，什么时候纯单机游戏能去掉这些硬拖游戏时长的无谓刷刷刷啊……  剧情褒贬不一是有原因的。黑神话正如其标题，是对西游记的黑暗向解读，由妖怪的主视角来讲述故事，将原著中对欲与情的探讨、对神与佛的人性化处理放大为游戏的主旨。西游记虽然质疑、批判佛教，却没有脱离佛教；而黑神话呢，真结局还来复刻了一出“倒走西游”的经典阴谋论，就差明晃晃地把“佛是恶人”几个大字打在屏幕上了；这种看似展现另一种可能实际却是一边倒的说辞倒是完全背离了原著的朦胧感，转而更追求对于“反叛”的刻画。黑神话还对主要角色的经历（尤其是感情经历）作了大刀阔斧的改编。那这改编算不算“魔改”、是不是“乱编”？我想说的是，西游早已成为了一种文化符号，从古至今无数二创作品对其的改编并没有让原著失色，反而是让西游这个题材愈发饱满、角色更加鲜活。一个时代也有一个时代的审美和追求。改编如果改得有理有据、能自圆其说，本身是没有什么问题的，问题在于理由不充分、故事不完整的改编。很遗憾地，黑神话的后两章故事过于仓促了，游科究竟删掉了多少剧情我们不得而知，只能希望DLC可以补全一部分。  批评的话讲了一大堆，真不是我不喜欢这个游戏。正相反，我是喜欢得不得了。黑神话确确实实是俺们小破村飞出来的金凤凰；作为商品好看也好卖，更难能可贵的是它作为游戏是真的好玩。虽然依然存在着一些不成熟的设计，但“完成比完美更重要”这句话说得没错。至少，做出来了，便是胜利。  玩第一章的时候，我一向歧视电子游戏的爸妈也凑来一起“中年大学习”了。一家人坐一起围观杨戬的重男发言有些微妙，不过更多的还是感动。我的老爸甚至还主动去了解了什么是3A游戏、听了黑神话的小曲、看了游戏里的过场CG，晚上散步的时候还兴奋地和我一起讨论……上一次一部作品能如此破圈、跨越年龄的限制将人们联系在一起，是什么时候？  正如结尾动画的标题《未竟》，希望黑神话仅仅只是个开始。衷心期待国产单机越来越好。,985.0,2024-09-09 18:55:23,Recommended

0.826146125793457,schinese,[h1]优缺点都极其明显和势均力敌的一款作品，最终优点略胜一筹[/h1]   我会分几个大点来讲：画面，音乐/声效，玩法/战斗，UI/无障碍选项，以及剧情。   [h1]画面[/h1]  第九世代开启，初见虚幻5演示之初，很多喜爱极致画面的玩家对Epic展示的Demo可以说是赞不绝口。更真实的光照技术以及细致许多的材质都让人震惊游戏的画面还能继续发展到这番地步。然而，随着半个世代的过去，大多数虚幻5游戏首发优化表现不佳，让甚至众多高端显卡机器都败下阵来，且对比以前游戏的画面进步时而被总结为乏善可陈，甚至倒退。  《黑神话：悟空》是少数将画面和细节做到有肉眼可见进步的游戏，地图的各种材质细节都让我仿佛回到了当初观看虚幻5演示的模样。游戏内使用的粒子特效，也极大增加了法术和战斗氛围的沉浸感。  优化虽不是顶尖但也尚可接受，我的3080TI +12900K 电脑在大多数时候1440P （DLSS质量+设置全高）基本跑80帧左右是没有问题的，但后期的体验的确出现了更多的掉帧和卡顿，而拥有低于我硬件性能的好友表示这种现象更为严重。纵然没有了像近年知名厂商大作以及各种虚幻5游戏发售期间的优化灾难，但依旧有不小的进步空间需通过更新来达到。尤其是开启光追会导致延迟被狂拉高，肯定是会让想要开启极致画面的高端显卡用户略失望的。  若感到游戏画面偏糊，也是因为游戏的默认锐化等级被设置到了3.6667，而不是正常的1，可通过下载Mod进行修改。游戏中有一层类似迷雾一样一直伴随的特效也可能对部分玩家的观感会造成影响，同样可以通过下载Mod来解决。至于官方会不会更新这个，我既然写出来自然是希望会的，现在是无奈只能用民间高手的办法。  [h1]音乐/声效[/h1]   《黑神话：悟空》的音乐质量是觉得过硬的，它做到了在需要它的时候发挥关键的作用。  许多歌曲都有着不是活泼就是气势磅礴的感觉，很好地陪衬了剧情画面和Boss战斗。也有一些比较阴暗的歌曲，搭配更黑暗的地图和剧情。  活泼如熊竹英老师作为无头僧（[spoiler]灵吉[/spoiler]）在第二章沙漠回歌颂的几首二胡小曲，帮助天命人获得新的技能，提醒他注意敌人的位置和如何破局。  https://youtu.be/2PHqki02vUI?si=37RLwdWl7jTT8V-q  气势磅礴的歌曲如游戏前期就播放的经典老曲《云宫迅音》，《善恶若无报》，《法天象地》等。  阴暗氛围的歌曲有《妙音妙音》，《哪有怜香惜玉心》，《虫儿也欺负人哩》。这类更多都是来自于第四章的Boss歌曲。一遇到虫子Boss就挺毛骨悚然的...  接下来是游戏的声音效果，比如挥动棒子时，下雪，敲打金属的这些声音。我觉得都已经足够真实，可以进步的空间不大，在棍子敲打敌方防御护盾的时候我甚至听出了打铁的味道...这方面的反馈我是觉得已经够好了，环境声也没问题。  [h1]玩法/战斗[/h1]  [b]a.战斗[/b]  这块是游戏开始有争议的部分。游戏科学之前说过这款游戏更接近于《战神》，没有普遍的类魂游戏那么难。然而和战神其实还是有不少区别。《战神》的攻击和奔跑是“无限耐力”，《黑神话》有耐力条。《战神》可以扔斧扔矛，天命人除非使用立棍或者跳上去平台，远程的小兵打你只能用棍花弹开攻击，也不能反弹回去。再就是存档方面，《战神》允许在各种地方进行存档，《黑神话》想要玩转自己的游玩存档得去文件里专门捣鼓一波，因为它存档只在土庙（休息点），捡东西或者打败Boss的时候。  除了这些和《战神》的不同点之外，《黑神话》在部分Boss的出招能力上限和逻辑也都难称得上简单，这同样增加了难度。大多数Boss可以说是容易和颇具挑战这两个的其中之一，但有些Boss因为能触发致命连招和大范围攻击不太好躲开，导致天命人很容易变成猴肉馒头（悲）。也有一些Boss的可攻击点不多搞得天命人会一直锁定对着空气打。  当然也完全没有难到过不了关的情况，背好Boss招式，尝试不同的Build套装，技能组合，都是可以的。即使游戏在不变身的状况下，只有棍子这一种武器可以使用，还是能通过强化不同的技能，属性依旧能玩出许些不同的花样。然而，这未必对所有人都是说的这般容易。  像大多数游戏一样，游戏科学把《黑神话》经常会看到的加载页面用作于玩法小提示的放置处，但这些提示仅留存于比较表面的机制介绍，比如你的装备可以升级，你要注意耐力云云。在前期很有用，到了后期需要知道战斗技巧和一些物品用途的时候，游戏就不给更多提示了。比如玩家其实有无限次使用的道具可以传送到土庙，可以跳后迅速打出一个漂亮的劈棍，蓄力两点重击可以打断Boss的一些攻击，还有搅棍只要耐力允许是可以一直弄下去把敌人搞死的（棍花也可以）。  给予的战斗提示偏少很容易让不怎么熟悉这类动作游戏的玩家感到一些迷茫，好在现在的视频平台上有很多分享不同打法帮助的视频，但如果一款游戏玩家需要看视频来保证通关的频率越高，就越代表它不简单，从而设立了一定的游玩门槛。如果你对较高挑战难度的游戏并不感冒，《黑神话》的确能将你拒之门外。  且从妖王或者头目的密集度来看，称其玩法为Bossrush是不为过的。小怪是有的，也不少，但小怪有些也不是吃素的啊！还很喜欢搞偷袭，群殴，不讲武德也！每次跑路遇到这个情况的时候总会有那么些次成了不经意的初见杀。当然，如果你更在乎的是击败Boss获取的成就感，以及和这些不讲武德的小怪谈笑风生，那么《黑神话》还是有足够让比较厉害或者坚持不懈的玩家能获取不错的满足感。  [b]b.指引和地图[/b]  除了加载页面的提示，《黑神话》的引导基本都做进了台词或者是指向你去土庙的光束，告诉你找到了新的地点。但是台词这玩意，你稍不留神就可以忘记过场动画里头说过啥了。有些NPC对话是可重复的还好一些，过场动画里头的就不一定记得住了。而且如果你中途需要离开，CG是不可被暂停的，我不知道是什么原因，但这在今天是有点不太应该的。希望后面会更新能暂停CG的功能。 最要命的还是地图。和FromSoftware以前的游戏一样，游戏内不具有地图，玩家只能自己找路。但《黑神话》有个大问题也就是空气墙，会出现在各种反直觉位置上。比如这个平台你能跳上去，但你跳不上去，因为你被墙卡了。还有这个河你能走过去，但你不可以通过这个位置走，另一个位置才没墙。这种现象也许可以变相看待是一种指引，强制告诉玩家哪里可探索哪里不可探索，你能走顺的尽是道路，走不顺不走也罢。但这毕竟只是因为没有游戏内地图让玩家不得不采用的一种探索方式，这种现象通常是令人困扰和反感为主的，因为明明有路偏不能走，本可以节省很多时间，但就是不得。  地图的规模在后续的章节也变得越来越绕和开始复杂起来，并非绕不出去，但由于天命人既没有地图看也没办法在一个位置留下标记，告诉自己走过此处，在场景极其相似的地点里会容易再走过一遍同样的路，这在我的游玩体验中出现了数次，而对于耐心不是太高的玩家只会带来更多烦躁。  [b]c.收集刷刷刷[/b]  游戏里有几个收集项，分别是种子，盘坐（免费拿升级点），怪物图鉴，精魂，葫芦，以及所有的装备。别的都还好，一周目就算错过了，二周目都能再轻松找到。种子只能靠刷，而且爆率极低。《绝地：幸存者》让我烦的找不到东西，《黑神话：悟空》方便寻找可却难以获得。如果你缺钱缺经验，那就得无脑刷刷刷了，没有别的好办法，不够强就得苦练！  [h1]UI/无障碍选项[/h1]  《黑神话》的UI 设计是有点问题的，比例不可调整，无法设置别的颜色，左边吃药的略缩图UI 根本无法第一眼看出具体是什么药，完全靠背什么位置装的什么药，或者在使用前按下扳机键放大UI看到药的名字。  耐力，血量，法力值三个条都很重要，但是血量条的大小远大于另外两个条，在游戏一开始的时候导致注意力都只是放在了血量而不是最下面的耐力条。蓝条是因为颜色过于醒目所以没被无视的太厉害，哪怕耐力条不能改大小，位置更改（比如放在中间）或者改颜色也可以做到可以的效果。这并非绝对必要的设计，但倘若问《黑神话》和现今最受好评的大制作游戏还有怎样的差距，这就是其中之一。  字幕同样有着类似的问题，无法改颜色，无法改大小，无法添加黑色背景，导致在一些环境下，根本看不见，对视力有点问题的人也直接不友好了。  最后一点就是蜘蛛恐惧症选项，当然有Mod也可以用Mod来解决，倒不一定非要官方搞。有些玩家对蜘蛛的恐惧感可以说是拉满了的，盘丝洞这章会打的很憋屈，如果有这个选项倒是可以缓解不少，把蜘蛛全部变成馒头眼睛之类的东西，失去让人恐惧的特征。  [h1]剧情[/h1]  小心剧透。  全游戏争议最大的就是剧情，主要聚焦在就是标题的人物：孙悟空。  《黑神话》设定下的悟空是一个和白骨精有恋情，被二郎神和四大天王几下就搞定的大猴子。  先不管他反天庭二次的理由，明明有了上一次的经验，他又要去反，西游记整个旅程直接被全盘否定了。最后战败的是二郎神这块也很有问题，但我觉得，明知单枪匹马反抗的结果就会是失败告终还要反的问题更大，因为这体现了孙悟空在这里毫无智商只有头铁。散落成的遗物流放给了各路妖魔鬼怪尽情使用，不仅没有给人间带来更多益处，反而是黄眉等人统治下的乱世。  因此，全剧细想最不吸引人的角色，就是标题的悟空。他被降智，实力被砍（最终Boss战打残躯的时候反而重新认识了），衍生出来了让人措手不及的儿女情长，还是个背刺好友（牛魔王）的阴险小人，一个角色让人感到无语的地方他全占了。降智顺带的实际上还有二郎神，二郎神和孙悟空如果开场的战斗是做局，这局做的非常烂。孙悟空现在已没法收到佛祖的紧箍咒限制，战力就是完整的，天命人可以获得孙悟空原先的战力多少完全就是未知数，二郎神不选择组队反而是带着四大天王亲自打碎孙悟空，那你到底是不是一队的？然后这俩偷偷又有啥感情了？硬要磕相爱相杀是吧，真牢啊真牢啊...  游戏剧情的高光部分反而是在于对其他反派的塑造和二师兄的角色表现。二师兄与天命人的讲话和互动是整个游戏阴暗剧情最光鲜亮丽的部分，他说话的一贯风趣和对过去的回忆都让人听着津津有味。而他角色在剧情里展开的剧情在没有过于背弃人设的情况下，也给这个角色的悲情元素有了应得的探讨。选择西天取经夺走了他能拥有一个完整的家的机会，这将会成为他余生无奈的悔恨。他也借这番故事超脱了“猪八戒照镜子，里外不是人”的谚语，因为他照镜子的那一刻真正看到了天蓬元帅。  其他反派比如金池，黄眉，黑熊精，不空都配合着每章结尾的精心制作CG得到了完整的背景故事和个性。黑熊的狡诈，金池的贪念，黄眉的偏执，不空的伪善，在战败他们并观看相关的CG后，给予的是浩大的满足感。其他一些算是亦正亦邪的Boss比如 不能 从台词和架势上也感到与其他Boss不同，读完背景故事更是得到了确认。这些有趣值得玩味的人设让阅读游戏内的相关文献很有一种津津乐道之足。  可惜同样的话完全无法对整篇故事围绕的孙悟空去说。因为当你看到CG知道了《黑神话》想要带来的悟空后，你感到的更多是困惑，并质疑这一路上你作为天命人的旅途所继承的东西。 不断轮回是故事的主题之一。不断有天命人“重走西游”，黄眉不断地自我感动论证其的歪门邪念，天庭不断地培养新的妖怪练成丹药。《黑神话》真结局的意味应该是轮回终于有了变数，天命人挑战二郎神成功，获得了其的三尖刀，战胜了大圣残骸，获得孙悟空的全数力量。可接下来他是否还会继续挑战天庭？就算他比孙悟空强大许多，又怎能战胜如来？即使他做到了推翻了天庭，也挺不过轮回，这时又怎么办？《黑神话》的结尾到底想要的是一个游戏科学眼里所谓更完整的，没有污点的大圣带来新的希望，还是一个无法逃脱轮回和压迫的大圣，一路黑到底？我觉得游戏科学很可能原本想给出一个答案，但他们没有时间了，只好砍成了一个没讲完的故事。然而绝对可以肯定的是，如果你希望大圣的形象是正面的话，《黑神话》讲的不是这个故事。倘若不能接受，敬而远之。  [h1]结语[/h1]  《黑神话：悟空》在画面，稳定性，声音这些基本功相当扎实，呕心沥血的付出和各路业界大佬的支持都算是功不可没。但在其他方面有着相对不太成熟的表现，部分Boss的设计，探路的体验，以及匮乏的无障碍/自定义选项，都让其对比最高档制作游戏有着绝对的差距。剧情的不完整，以及对齐天大圣传统形象的偏离，说是整款游戏最大的短板或许并不为过。这是一款若能接受其中缺点依然值得原价或小折扣购买的游戏，也是近些年完整度和稳定性足够对得起价格的游戏。希望国内还有其他的开发者能借此势头打造出自己风格的游戏，并凭借自己的完整度，荣获众多地区玩家的喜爱。,5182.0,2024-09-01

0.7593995332717896,schinese,直到发售我都没有购买，不是不感兴趣，不是不喜欢，只是处在如今这么一种「吃过见过」的状态里，很难有什么东西能让我有热血澎湃、非买不可的感觉了。现在的我更喜欢将欲望搁置、暂时延迟，等到最佳时刻再入手的快感。毕竟后来这些年对我来说是「早买早　难　受，晚买享折扣」。不过每天还是有去翻看相关内容，就这么看了 8 天后，有四个借口催促着我按下了购买键——「配乐太棒了！」「章节动画真好看！」「老公你打这个给我看~」「不行打俩小时再退款。」  然后第一次玩就打了 4.8 个小时……  之后每天左看看，右挠挠，在老婆的注视下，最终花了 43.1 小时双结局通关。感觉又是那种量大管饱、细节可推敲、完全无法让我几下就能把感受表达清楚的好东西，所以再次选择这种「想到哪说到哪」的叙述方式，不着急，慢慢来。  ……  我那像「忒修斯之船」一样的电脑终究是老了，打起来真卡。在狗牙、一步一卡中硬是走过了一关又一关。 声音……感觉响度总是忽大忽小的。 好黑啊，好亮啊，这光影怎么调啊？还得下软件？算了。 更新下驱动试试……真的好多了！但久了还是会卡……重进游戏试试……又好多了！ 据说帧生成会增加操作延迟，关掉试试……的确稳定了，但动作也僵硬了不少。 低情商：优化不好。高情商：老设备也能玩！  ……  原来是 Boss Run 啊，怪不得小怪比较单调，Boss 都要比小怪多了，笑。 难度还可以，但大多时候没有初见杀。因为到新地点会卡，遇到新敌人会卡，新敌人放新招数更会卡…… 想起了 JoJo 里的 Dio，「砸瓦鲁多！(The World)」，然后我的时间就被暂停了（卡住），但 Boss 看着卡但它其实并不卡，无奈地狂按翻滚，仍免不了被其一通猛抽。 这有个紫色的大头和尚……这么猛？！还会「地爆天星」？！不行我跟你杠上了。重试 5 次后搞定。 我觉得自己不擅长受苦型游戏，但通关后发现，能让我重试超过 5 次的好像就只有「大圣残躯」以及「杨戬」。很多能初见杀的却没做到，是因为……「砸瓦鲁多」…… 时常边玩边有个念头冒出来。《黑魂》？《艾尔登法环》？《只狼》？《装甲核心》？《仁王》？《卧龙》？《战神》？……可能都像，但也可能最像它自己。 有中文配音真好啊~但个别角色的演技感觉不是太好，有读稿的味道。不过绝大多数都不错。满足。 怎么到处都有这个小钟？打打看。然后这口钟就在地图里滚啊滚啊滚…… 我很喜欢在充满压抑的世界中，有「蒲团」这么个东西。它可以打破节奏，让我暂时抛开紧张，坐下来深吸一口气，然后慢慢吐出去。听我最爱的风声、水声、鸟语声，看本该可怖却突然显得那么和谐安宁的山山水水。（可惜这蒲团太素了，不是肉的） 正在战斗，突然有个圆了吧唧的东西从显示器旁边向我冲来，吓得我一激灵……结果发现是那个刚才打倒的钟……滚啊滚啊滚……  ……  卡关了……太难了……我受不了了……不想玩了…… 没错，就是卡在监狱这关的独木桥上了。满地图的空气墙，偏偏这会不见了。前面还有弓箭手和小刺客，分分钟把你踹到下层。更恶心的是还摔不死，只能回城重来。 后来跑到中间，用花棍挡开弓箭，再冲刺躲开刺客才过去。 然后就碰到了无数人在自制地图里标记过的「高几率卡死点」，你别说，触发后还真的就只能强制关闭，重启游戏了。 这种卡死点，我碰到过三个。%…#￥） 火焰山的两只隐身老鼠，刚开始还现形，后来怎么一直隐身啊？是我搞错了什么？需要特定道具、技巧？结果发现，这是 BUG …… 打杨戬，进不去地图，只能看着他像动物园的猴子一样对我开大，还打不着。我进不去，他出不来。这也是 BUG …… 人身虫尾的百眼魔君，那么长的蜈蚣身子，锁定却只能锁在那么小的人身上？！下方居然还有那么大的空气墙，导致我打不着？！发现好多 Boss 都自带空气墙，无语。可这不是 BUG……  ……  音乐真挺好的。好不好听先不说，但起码不装高雅，也不恶俗。新版《云宫迅音》，吉灵菩萨的陕北说书，小西天听起来那么神圣又那么毒邪，偏偏讽刺的命名为《屁》的音乐等等全都很棒。当时正在玩命翻滚，躲避「不白」的毒、冰攻击（这俩字放一起写可得注意顺序，还有粉、白），突然响起了《往生咒》……我感觉有什么东西被升华了。 其实我对音乐还挺挑剔的（虽然自己做的跟粑粑一样），我其实不太怕难听，但巨怕恶俗。这也是为什么我不太喜欢短视频的其中一个理由，往往有着那么好的画面，配个让我 5 秒就会生理不适的曲子……感觉像有人在我的耳朵里呕吐似的。 文字方面，之前几乎所有游戏的文字我都是不想读的，我是很喜欢看书，但在游戏里看书……总让我觉得像是得到一块钻石，然后拿去切玻璃。可以，但没必要，而且有种糟蹋东西的感觉。不过《黑神话》的我读了不少，想起了在我很小的时候，父母上班，都会把我送到爷爷奶奶家，然后我翻出一本纸张发黄变脆的《聊斋志异》。虽然很多时候我的审美有点崇洋媚外（毕竟很多软实力的东西跟国外确实有着至少几十年的差距），但我真的很喜欢中国古代故事，它们往往真实的可怕，结局往往突兀，却都能散发出诱人的魔力。边读这些故事，边让我恍惚，感觉这些家伙们变得越发鲜活起来，有血有肉。 动画就真的没什么好说的了，之前绝大多数游戏我都很厌烦那些过场动画，尤其是二次元粉丝向的，它们总是能简单的让我感觉在慢性自杀。可这游戏的动画就像是电影，精巧、新奇、镜头感足、信息量大、不拖沓，每一个镜头我都不想落下。想起了前段时间的《中国奇谭》。所以原来我不是讨厌在游戏里看故事，而是你这个故事，最好它配叫故事。  ……  剧情方面已经有很多种说法与解释了，我就不再多赘述。只想说一嘴「猪八戒」。他并不高大上，也不伟光正，在这么压抑的世界里，有个小猪跟着你到处跑，陪你战斗，你受点伤他就给你治疗，你不动了他会讲故事，甚至吐槽。捡个果子会说「呸，不好吃！」定住敌人后会夸奖「定的好！」自己受过那么多辈子的苦，一边嘟囔抱怨，一边却对你百般照顾，不离不弃。看着他被迷了心神，放下嬉笑怒骂各种不正经后既坚毅又痛苦的样子，很是心疼。在船上，老猴子各种大道理指责悟空，而他却「师兄师兄」的各种袒护。最终战你要离开船，他甚至大喊「好侄子！打不过就跑！悟空的名头，咱不要也罢！」我一直很在乎人的目的，对我来说他总是在袒护你，心疼你，你仅仅存在着对他来说就很重要。他像是我从来没体会到过的长辈，一位憨厚又像太阳一样温暖的亲人。我的哭点很高，但我心里有哽咽的味道。（卧槽，我老婆看这段时哭了 0.0）  ……  打了那么多的强敌，刷了那么多的材料，看了那么多的故事，进行了那么多的思考。很多人说「瑕不掩瑜」，可对我来说那「瑕」就像是麦田中的一根稻草，不值一提。我不喜欢给作品评分，因为太过主观，随着时间和成长，评价也容易变动。但在「Fine」「OK」「Good」等游戏分类里，我毫不犹豫地将其放在了「Great」里。我也不喜欢「三观正」这种非对即错、非黑即白的说法，但这种几乎没有善恶只有利益的世界，高强度符合我的价值观。另外，前阵子不管看到哪条相关内容，都流行喊一句「文化输出」。我也不喜欢这种拔高调、攀龙附凤、扭曲了本质的说法。对我来说，就像是我知道有人会做出一桌好菜，现在终于成真，来自五湖四海的同好纷纷坐下，大快朵颐。曾经吃过一些的我笑着问道「好吃吧？」他抬起头，咧开了泛着油光的嘴巴笑道「嗯！」  能和你一起享用，我很荣幸。  [b][quote]欢迎订阅我的「个人鉴赏家[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/11123770/] DEV RULES [/url]」 以及 [url=https://space.bilibili.com/2898054/]游戏实况[/url] 来观看我的更多“偏见想法” [spoiler]希望有天能厉害到你会跟别人说： DEV？那是我朋友诶！[/spoiler][/quote][/b],3232.0,2024-09-09 13:09:08,Recommended
0.7593364119529724,schinese,一个三十三岁的男人，玩了游戏应该有二十年了~~STEAM也用了挺多年的了~~人生第一次在STEAM写评价。因为电脑是A卡，刚发售的时候玩不了~会跳出~~等修复期间为了不被剧透，任何关于黑神话的内容都跳过，瞄到有个黑字的内容都赶紧刷掉怕剧透影响体验。今天终于通关了，可以好好写下感受，玩之前我是用最低预期来期待这个游戏的，毕竟以前很喜欢的国产游戏如河洛出的系列，仙剑系列，古剑系列（古剑还可以不过当时期望太高）都翻车了，所以难免怕失望。  但是黑神话玩下来，我真的看到了国产的游戏的希望。首先是画面，我认为做出了属于中国特色的画面，能媲美国外的精美且又由地方特色。其次是打击感，我认为对于我这种鬼泣，法环等等动作游戏玩了不少的人来说，我是满意的，非常不错。其次是细节，每一章结束的总结中国风动画让我非常的惊喜。最后是剧情，虽然剧情还是需要更加打磨，因为没有引导，所以有时候剧情会不够连贯，但是总的来说也是不错的了，有个8分。整个游戏唯一让我不够满意的是没有地图，这个后面玩家可以用mod解决。  总体来说，超于预期，对得起国人的期望。可以算是国产3A里程碑式的游戏了，很希望能出黑神话二。  最后想说下，最近发现身体出了些状况，可能会比较麻烦，又不敢去检查怕自己更忧虑。希望在我还活着的有生之年，还能看到黑悟空二，黑悟空三，以及更多游戏的国产游戏。,573.0,2024-09-14 13:18:11,Recommended
0.7590983510017395,schinese,从20年亮相到24年发售整整四年时间， 黑神话悟空 这部作品总算是和大家见面了。我个人对于国产游戏不是特别感冒（因为在印象里国产游戏的质量都比较参差），所以一直保持了观望，直到发售前不久才开始关注。在国内氪金、网游的大环境下，虽然之前也出现过不少优秀的游戏作品，但多为体量不大的独立游戏，想要跨越技术水平、制作经验凭空打造出一部高规格、高质量的作品，几乎可以算是一个不小的“奇迹”了。然而就在国内外众多玩家的期待注视下，如同“猴王出世”般， 黑神话悟空 完全超乎了我的意料。  从先前的实机演示就能看出来，一流的画面质量，场景细节的丰富，战斗特效的华丽，独特的中式禅意美学。高规格的华丽演出。恰到好处的配乐，无需本土化的中文配音。国产游戏技术水平也一举跻身到了当今顶尖水准。 我的电脑4060 2k影视级画质，不打开光追，开启Dlss质量能稳定在50帧左右，但帧率波动略大。调到Dlss性能能稳定在60帧，个别大场景或boss战会掉帧到40左右，但不会持续太久，优化还算可以。  游戏流程采用了章节关卡制推进。覆满植被树木的山野林间，黄沙漫天的黄风岭，白雪皑皑的小西天，等等。不同关卡都各有着不一样的风格，敌人。但对于关卡、地图设计（特别地图设计）这一方面，我个人只能给予 一般 的评价。 前两关的线路相对线性，更偏向于Boss Rush。中期的两个关卡内容极其丰富，盘丝洞隐藏部分的内容，甚至单拎出来作为一个小章节都不为过。相比之下后期两个章节的内容就显得单薄了许多。使得整个游戏的游玩体验并不平衡。 地图可谓是错综复杂，布满分支岔路、开阔场景。好处是，能激发玩家的探索欲，增加多周目重复游玩的趣味性，收获意外之喜。坏处就是爱迷路的玩家会不断发出：“这是哪？”“路呢？”“我咋又回到这儿了？”的疑问。不少空旷开阔场景也没什么意义。第六章关卡几乎没啥设计可言，直接将Boss分布在几个空地，坐着筋斗云挨个飞过去就完了。且游科是真的真的很喜欢藏，这不仅仅是对于游戏内的，也包括游戏外的宣发等。在不查找攻略的情况下，很多地方普通玩家可能通个三遍也发现不了。引导也不给你摆在台面上，而是隐藏在台词、文本之中。我不知道这样的设计是不是学习了 魂 ，但魂类地图峰回路转的精髓之处并没有得到较好的体显。   黑神话悟空 以ARPG作为游戏玩法，同时也能看见不少类魂元素。这样的类型没点经验还是挺难做的，而游戏科学却交出了一份出色的答卷。不论是游戏的动作流畅度还是玩法的操作性都足以称得上优秀。 虽然有 魂 元素在，但难度真不算高， 魂 阴间的东西没学太多（除了浮屠塔能看见一些影子），且没有死亡掉落惩罚，土地庙（篝火）间的距离分布也比较合理。 玩家所操控的 天命人 ，虽然主要只使用 棍 这一武器（游戏中还有长枪），但有三种不同的棍法（劈、立、戳），以攒满，打出棍势为核心。战场上其实对于敌人招式应对手段并不算多，只有翻滚闪避（还有加点的识破）（我刚进入游戏，习惯性以为左肩键是防御，结果却是棍花）。但强在猴哥会的招数实在过多，法术，七十二般变化，样样精通，还傍有各类法宝相助。 大部分的能力、道具都可以加点、升级，且更友善的是这些有成长的，也都可以根据需要免费洗点重铸，以面对不同的情境。也正因为技能树足够庞大，一周目通关很多能力都是加不满甚至空白的。变化分为化身和变身，化身即为短暂变身使出招式。而变身则大有门道，能让 天命人 一定时间内直接变为所选择的角色，且拥有一套自身独立的战斗机制。 但并不代表你就能在三界横着走，角色的构筑派生并不算多，而且面对妖王级别的Boss，不攒满棍势或使用技能，打出的伤害都足够的刮（痧）。敌人类型繁多，几乎没有换皮重复出现。耳熟能详的妖怪形象也根据原著设定得到了还原，Boss的动作设计、战斗体验也称得上独一无二（当然也存在一些比较屎的Boss，比如百眼魔君前腿在碰撞体积上有问题，非常容易空棍，导致我卡了三个多小时）。当面对妖王释放出几乎无解的恐怖招数时，玩家也可以想想原著中是如何应对的，找到针对性的法宝能直接事半功倍（是的，又给你藏东西了）。一般来说多Boss的战斗，体验上往往偏向于恼人的群殴，但本作的双敌人Boss在设计上十分得巧妙，他们会默契配合打出连环招式。击败Boss掉落的素材奖励，也是铸造不同的武器、披挂（装备）的主要来源。 游戏的主要回复手段，也有着新颖的设定，分为葫芦、酒、泡酒物三个部分组成，各自合理搭配，会产生不一样的组合效果。 还有一点，我在面对一些非人形或会飞\跳的敌人时的视角锁定体验非常糟糕。  黑神话悟空 的故事发生在西行结束师徒四人成佛之后。简单概括，序章大战孙悟空死后，化作六个根器，其中五个被妖王所占，而玩家所扮演的 天命人 踏上了击败妖王集齐根器复活大圣的道路...期间，不仅猪八戒会助力玩家前行，一路上还会遇见西游记中一些熟悉的人物角色。 中国玩家也终于有了独属于自己的文化浪漫。游戏科学对于，美术、文化，以及细节，都有非常高的追求。不论是场景建筑、雕塑，游戏内的文本（影神录\图鉴），章节间的独立动画，都能呈现出了华丽的中式美学。而敌人的受击硬直动作，不同反应的对话、演出，也体现了对于细节的把控。 虽然严格来说章节与章节间剧情的连贯性并不大，且如果（我说如果）对西游原著了解较少，可能会感到游戏的故事莫名其妙，加上游科又喜欢藏，整体来说，剧本叙事方面是非常非常碎片化的。目前我所知的两个结局，也仍旧存在很多让人疑惑的坑，不知会不会在DLC中得到更为完整的补足。   黑神话悟空 绝对是中国3A迈出的里程碑式一步，它作为国产游戏的意义不言而喻，但即便抛开这些附加情怀，本身也是一部优秀的作品。我一周目流程时长约为40小时，且还有不少内容没有探索完全，所以原价买入也绝对不会亏的。推荐喜欢西游题材，动作游戏的玩家入手。,2397.0,2024-09-22 17:45:40,Recommended

0.7114123106002807,schinese,“若不披上这件袈裟 众生又怎知我尘缘已断、金海尽干”    游戏中的这一句话真的是直击心灵，曾几何时我还在游戏业里摸爬滚打的时候，看到国内网络游戏 手游赚取了远超一般3A大作的利润，我一度认为国内游戏业似乎永远也不需要3A游戏了，然而就像金池长老的袈裟一样，有时候这是一种枷锁，有时候却也是一种动力。如今的中国游戏业的利润产出冠绝全球，但是依然缺的就是这么一件“袈裟”，有了它，世界才会关注到中国游戏业是一股不可忽视的力量。《黑神话悟空》做到了，它成了这一件袈裟，不管它让多少人欣喜或者破防，它就是今年最大的话题之作，直接荣登3A大作之列，也终于轮到让老外们开始费尽心思去理解我们从小耳熟能详的故事了。    纵观整个游戏，最大的感受就是“完整”，系统设计、画面、音效、动作、关卡剧情各方面都可以说达到了一个很均衡的状态，大家所诟病的一些瑕疵诸如空气墙、一些粪怪BOSS、稍显仓促的结局，其实都可以归为经验不足，但它的基底是优秀的，不然花费70多小时去打全成就，就会成为一件煎熬的事情，而《黑神话》显然还没有到让人煎熬的程度。    游戏的第一章引导的很棒，充满神秘感，并且由于完整的复现了当初预告片中的部分初见内容，可以说是一开场就让玩家吃下了定心丸，至少我认为整章玩完，让我相信游科没有拿预告骗人。第二章，则是完成度最高的一章，影神图、对话、场景、关卡设计结合的很好，特别是打完国王父子后的两条分叉路，设计的很绝，因为两条路都能完整的形成一条闭环并在同一个地方收尾，同时这也是除开第一章以外唯一一章我通过自行发掘线索做完所有任务的地图，疯虎线只要认真读了影神图就应该能有头绪。第三章则是内容过多且中间插入了一个箱庭地图导致整体体验比较割裂和受罪，但是最后的动画直接让第三章的立意封神。第四章在剧情上稍微有些失望，因为第四章的剧情是之前的预告片里被讨论与深挖的最多的剧情点，实际剧情却很简略，略微对不起期待。第五章就太短了，可以感到制作组已经有些力不从心，很勉强的完成了剧情。第六章则是已经到了团队能力的极限了，筋斗云是个设计团队与玩家都觉得很酷的设定，但是使用筋斗云在地图上飞奔的体验很难做出有效引导，并且伴随严重的性能问题，体验不算太好，该章节的部分BOSS也是读指令有点太明显了。不过瑕不掩瑜，游戏在初见的30 40小时以内已经给到了足够的刺激，这一点已经很难得了。    很多人认为游戏有点魂系，但我认为不是，它的内核和魂系完全不同，它不筛选玩家，天命人的技能和各种装备以及没有死亡惩罚，足以让玩家开发出各种打法来应对BOSS，强力玩家自然可以挑战自我，手残玩家也不必勉强，游戏系统鼓励你逃课，相比预告片，游戏的难度已经下降了很多了，这种为了让更多的玩家体验完整游戏的做法值得点赞。游戏里面基本上很少有数值怪或者换皮怪，基本上能够一直保持新鲜感，难度适中，大部分敌人稍微打几次就能摸清套路，当然游戏里依然有好几个精心设计的BOSS是成心不让你快速过的，但这些BOSS的设计本身就非常值得去挑战一下，它们的难不在数值，而是真正的招数变化，即便是背板也需要大量的练习才能打好。哪怕读指令也不是硬读，而是提醒你不要想着轮椅，比如大圣残躯一旦被控，你要是围观或者在旁边蓄力，他就会闪身过来，实际上是逼迫你短兵相接。杨戬则是如果不锁定他想着偷一个重棍，他也不会耍赖提前丢枪。这几个高难度BOSS都是在激励你大开大合的与之正面硬打，表现力、击破后的成就感都很爆棚。    最后说点题外话，很高兴看到国产3A一战成名，“国产游戏”这个让人又爱又恨的免死金牌，也在当下永远的被撤去了，因为黑猴的存在，国产游戏将与对应的竞品直接对决而不再有任何情怀加成，毕竟已经有人证明了国人能够做出优秀的作品，往后的来者，做不好就是做不好，没人会国产游戏降低标准了，这也算是一个可期待的开端吧！,1586.0,2024-09-29 23:16:12,Recommended

0.6446700692176818,schinese,"一次痛快的体验！只记得一周目打完了，直接就开了二周目，到目前为止，这五十多个小时的体验，真的挺感动的。 第一章的时候,玩家游玩的过程是比较常见的ARPG过程，没什么很让人恶心的地方，不过体验了完整的第一章之后，相信各位玩家就可以笃定，只要游戏后面的章节保持住了这个水平，“黑神话”肯定就能取得世界游戏史上的一次空前的成功。 毕竟，他给全世界玩家带来一种新鲜感，“黑神话”在世界范围内的成功，让全世界人意识到了，游戏背景可以不再是千篇一律的，可以不是乔治·A·罗梅罗作品中的丧尸背景，；可以不再是大家已经写烂了的各种神话——北欧神话，希腊神话，罗马神话；可以不是各种西方世界想象中的埃及，印加背景；也可以不是大多数中国人都不甚了解的新教、东正、伊斯兰；可以不是波澜壮阔的美国西部开拓史；可以不是惨绝人寰世界大战；也可以不是阿西莫夫、克拉克、海因莱因笔下令人浮想联翩的科幻题材；可以不是从托尔金、罗伯特·乔丹、乔治·马丁、C.S.刘易斯、J.K.罗琳笔下的西方奇幻世界；可以不是日本印象的武士、忍者，以上举的这些例子，说都说不完，但是黑神话跳脱出了以上的列举的范围，他开辟了一片全新的天地，让部分老外见到了一个有五千年底蕴国家的文化软实力，“黑神话”的美术真的是没得说，中国人太熟悉了，一款能让中国玩家颅内高潮的游戏，它有着完完全全、地地道道的中国味道，能让部分对大陆心有芥蒂的台湾网友都直呼不错。 第二章有点初见端倪了，宫崎英高的味道来了，但是就一点点，仅止于墙后藏小怪，毕竟黑神话这个游戏还是比较简单的，“黑神话”确实不是魂，因为前面比魂简单太多了（虽然我魂游玩得不多，但我也有这个感觉），后面技能点多了，打起来更简单，而且你能随时洗点，对不同的BOSS采取不同的应对手段，当然我所有的怪都是用劈棍打的，因为劈棍就够了，而且第二章藏的小惊喜还不少，当时我以为这就是游戏科学的游戏设计模式了，一个鼓励玩家探索的出色的动作冒险游戏。 结果到了第三章，一股子有点搞的感觉就来了，我感受到了恶意，比方说是近战配远程，或者不知道哪里会跳出来阴你一下的小怪，前面这些都是开胃小菜，也不算什么，但是掌灯狱使，这玩意时不时地出来，导致我打魔将·莲眼的时候被弹幕干死了几次，有点无语了，而且雪地的这种地图吧，还得好好优化。 第四章盘丝洞，绕得我这个初见的小白死去活来的，这时，才想起这是一个2024年的没有地图的游戏，其实这也没什么，没有地图也影响不大，但是有些寻路苦手肯定受不了，有地图也就是游戏体验更好吧，这一章有一个BOSS我还有点印象——毒敌大王，好像为了他专门搞了一套加毒抗的披挂，那天我才发现玲珑内丹可以刷。 第五章火焰山没什么好讲的，很线性的一张图，唯一的槽点可能是秒杀大铁球，我感觉吧，这个环节是不必要的，并且由于黑神话美术先行的特点，游戏内感觉躲藏指引并不明显，撞死了我好次啊，远超于打小黄龙，毒敌大王的次数。 第六章的时候，游戏科学把不会做大型怪的缺点暴露无疑，当然，前面的章节就很能体验到了，大怪身上的空气墙让你打不着，而且倏忽漂移的锁定位置，让你感觉还不如不锁定，不过前面的一些大型怪，玩家可以通过三段重击、拖刀计什么的解决，可能有的还不如一些小型的，有很多特效，会对玩家的电脑造成掉帧攻击的BOSS，但是这一章的就不一样了，你没有四个点你就别想了，有四个点你可能都打不着，三个点你就更别想了，完全打不着，还有一坨大粪——大石敢当，哈哈，真是个“有趣”的怪啊，而且第六章的地图空荡荡的，感觉确实不如前几章，我最喜欢的还是第二章，又有传统动作冒险游戏的爽，又有一种探索的惊喜，第三章也蛮好，风景宜人。 总的来说，这个游戏称不上完美，但是没有什么东西是完美的，大家都是活在追求完美的路上，但是该有空气墙的地方没有空气墙，不该有空气墙的地方一堆空气墙，这真的很难受。哦，对了，还有一个第四章的桥，我真醉了，死的次数怕是快赶上打寅虎了。但是对我来说，“黑神话”加上加加分项的分，比如出色的美术，熟悉的文化内核，爽快的BOSS RUSH；减掉减分项的分，比如反直觉的地图设计，很一般的优化，奇葩的各种第一次制作AAA游戏的小缺陷，也是一个有九分的游戏，是值得游玩的佳作，而且他取得的成就不已经是前无古人了吗？ 强烈推荐！！！ 恐怕有些无脑贬低黑神话的群体，在发售的当天，脑中还有着一股阴暗的思想在流动，希望“黑神话”可能会和数十年前的“血狮”一样，马上成为中国单机游戏产业迈向成功路上的滑铁卢，现在如何？服不服！ ",1855.0,2024-09-02 14:40:44,Recommended

0.9018259048461914,english,"[h1] 9 / 10 [/h1]  [b] For me, this is one of the best games in history! [/b]  This game is proof that a project doesn't need battle passes, paid cosmetics, or in-game shops to be successful. This is probably one of the most passionate games released in the past decade; the creativity and attention to detail are absolutely insane.  Starting with one of the top selling points: the graphics. The graphics are absolutely absurd; Unreal Engine 5 is the best-looking engine on the market as of 2024, and this game makes very good use of it. Yes, using UE5 means that the game sometimes has some high optimization problems, although they're minor compared to other UE5 titles released recently.  The combat and enemy variety in this game are simply absurd. Elden Ring is an amazing game, and even a game of that caliber still struggles to keep up with this game variety-wise. Every single enemy in this game is unique and original, with highly detailed models and movesets; there's only a very small amount of reused assets among the enemies and bosses. Some of the boss fights are creative enough to make your jaw drop. The game has a lot of different skills and movesets, transformations, and items to make the combat feel unique in each encounter. Although I gotta admit that I wish it had more spells.  The biggest problem with this game compared to other action games is definitely the limitations on exploration of the map. This game has an absurd amount of invisible walls and limitations on the terrain blocking exploration, sometimes even on clear paths that look like they'd be explorable otherwise. And this is the reason i'm not giving this game a 10/10.  The soundtrack fits very well with the theme of the game; the OSTs are magical and epic. Each chapter has an animation at the end with different art styles and music, with different stories and meanings. For a person who is not used to the main theme portrayed in this game, it's a magical experience for sure...  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in Chinese folklore and mythology. The story is amazing; I was totally unfamiliar with anything related to this theme, and after playing it, I gotta say I really want to know more about the general theme and meaning behind these stories.  I genuinely believe this game will be remembered throughout the years as one of the most passionate and successful projects in gaming history.",2420.0,2024-08-31 11:53:48,Recommended

Everything in this game works well together; the spirts, spells, vessels…all of them made for some really cool variety in gameplay. The ability to change your build on the fly is a huge plus and I loved the chapter-to-chapter format of the story. Animated cutscene story tales were an awesome touch to bring each chapter to a close. Most of all, I loved finding all the hidden areas and questlines along the way, figuring out secret items and bosses that you might not run into without exploring. All of the achievements were fun to go after, collecting all items and defeating every enemy to complete your journal is an awesome feeling to accomplish.

0.7183414101600646,english,"I guess this is a hot take, so bring on the clown awards, but in my opinion, Black Myth Wukong does not live up to the hype. It's absolutely lacking in so many ways I couldn't believe what I was playing based on the reviews I read and I'm sorry if that steps on the toes of your new favorite game, but it's true. I was in no way compelled to continue playing this after the first session and here's why:  For starters, the game's performance is unstable at best, even on my 3080ti, i9 CPU, 32GB RAM, liquid cooled machine. It constantly and unexpectedly dipped down to laughably low frame rates to the point that I thought the game was being ran by Microsoft Power Point, even with most of the settings on low and medium, RTX off, DLSS set to performance and frames capped at 120. Unacceptable.  Looking past that, the world traversal is some of the most boring gaming I've done in decades. There is nothing to do other than fight a handful of trash mobs, find some meditation spots and then fight bosses. And I mean like every 10ft, there's a new boss. I never even understand why I'm fighting them half the time and they're super forgettable. The title should really be ""Wukong: Boss Rush"" or something more accurate like that. I learn the fights just long enough to beat them and then I never think about them again after they're over.  And the game's scenery is so ridiculously bland that everything looks the same to me. There are no useful land marks and no map/minimap, so you're constantly getting lost and back tracking in circles. On top of that, they do absolutely nothing to make you 'feel' like a monkey God while running around. You have a basic sprint and that's it. No cool flips. No world interaction. No wall runs. No climbing. No swinging. No staff tricks. Not even a double jump... It is painfully boring to run around in this game and OMG the amount of invisible walls and dead ends that should be explorable is infuriating.  The core gameplay loop is: 1. sluggishly traverse through an uninteresting area 2. kill trash mobs until you stumble across a boss 3. spend an hour learning its gimmicky move set 4. finally beat it and repeat, that's it  This game is just way too shallow and bland right now. I got bored in the first sitting and I have no will to even finish it. I will admit though, that the bosses are beautifully crafted and have very imaginative designs that ultimately don't matter because they all seem to have the same basic concept: Rush-down AI, spam attacks, then reset every so often. It felt like I was fighting the same boss reskinned over and over and over, even after 20+ hours of play time. Not to mention that some fights are literally just ripped from other games with almost zero changes, like Ornstein and Smough for example.  Moving on from that, the game's main draw (the combat) is extremely hollow. There is no block system. No backstab system. No stealth system. You literally have a dodge and a stick. The rest comes from a handful of spells, stances and transformations (which are also inconsistent, like, why can't I even JUMP while I'm transformed???) The dodge windows feel awful. Enemies will stun lock you constantly. Tons of CC. Input scanning. Animation locks. Overpowered status effects like poison and fire. Spongy enemies with inflated health pools. Bosses become impervious to your attacks, but they can still hit you. Every cheesy trick in the book to create artificial difficulty and prolonged encounters. It is more frustrating than rewarding and when you finally beat something, you won't feel accomplished, you'll just be happy you got lucky enough to beat the enemy's gimmick one time after hours of failure with nothing to look forward to except doing it all over again in about 10ft.  Wukong, to me, is desperately trying to be a mash-up of Dark Souls and God of War, but it fails on both counts. I think the potential is there, but it still needs a while to cook before it gets to the level that these botted reviews would have you believe it's at. Make the areas/maps more interesting and less linear (a true open world would be even better). Bring these beautiful characters to the forefront and really lean into the story. Make the boss mechanics feel more unique in each fight. Improve the traversal. Optimize the performance. Fix these issues and the game's underlying potential will start to shine through.  It does some things well, like character designs, musical scores, graphics and beautifully cinematic moments, but it falls flat in so many other ways that I genuinely can't recommend this game in its current state. I really wish I hadn't purchased it yet, as it might be worth playing sometime late next year or in 2026. If not, maybe the inevitable Wukong 2 will hit the mark in ways this one couldn't, but as it stands, this ain't it for me. I would refund if I could. ----- Edit: For anyone who might be wondering why my playtime keeps going up after a review like this, it's quite frankly because I paid $60 for the game and I don't want that money to go to waste, so I'm going to finish it. Still VERY disappointed with what Wukong COULD have been though.",5152.0,2024-08-29 18:45:14,Not Recommended

[h1]Premise: [/h1]  The game reminds me a lot of Sekiro, the environments, the absence of a traditional stats leveling system, and the way you increase your core attributes, mana, and health. It also brings to mind Nioh 2, with the ability to equip spirits and its fast-paced gameplay that blends combos and stances seamlessly.  The storyline is captivating, brought to life with cartoonish cutscenes brimming with personality. It’s based on Journey to the West, and the game’s polish is evident throughout. The GUI is beautifully designed, sound effects hit just right, and the soundtrack is solid.  You play as a pre-made character to stay true to the storyline from the ancient Chinese novel. Armor and weapons are obtained through crafting with resources and currency you collect along the way. Flasks can be customized with items that give you temporary advantages, like increased defense or healing over time.  [h1] Mechanics and gameplay: [/h1]  Black Myth: Wukong doesn’t rely on traditional stats like endurance, strength, or agility. It offers a skill-based system. You unlock and enhance skills, switching between stances to explore different playstyles. Respeccing is quick and painless, letting you experiment without needing any annoying items, so you’re always in the action, ready to try something new.  When you die, there’s no soul-dropping. Seriously, who actually enjoys that feature? I’m glad they left it out.  However, the game does have some invisible map walls, and navigation can be a bit confusing at times and to me this is the biggest issue this game has so far.  The game kicks off strong, with great enemy variety, stunning maps, and a slew of unique bosses. The difficulty feels fair, not cheap like in Elden Ring.  You can equip trinkets, but you’ll stick with the same weapon, which you can modify and upgrade. There are no other weapons, but that doesn’t take away from the experience.  [h1]Performance:[/h1]  You’ll need a high-end PC to run this game smoothly, especially if you crank up the settings. It could use some optimization, and I wouldn’t be surprised if Denuvo is causing performance issues.  [h1]Sound and aesthetic: [/h1]  Voice acting is on point, and there are some interesting mechanics like transforming into an insect, bird, or fox, which adds a nice layer of variety.  [h1] Verdict: [/h1]  Overall, Black Myth: Wukong is a fantastic achievement. It’s got me excited to see what this studio does next. This game deserves its success, and I’m giving it a solid 9 out of 10.",2725.0,2024-08-29 05:55:08,Recommended

0.6263503432273864,english,"[h1] Black Myth: Wukong [/h1] [i] Every review is subjective and aligns with the perception, tastes, preferences and/or interests of the person writing it. I’m someone who views video games as another form of artistic expression, which is why I do NOT assign a score, I don't believe art can be measured or quantified, I’ll simply share my personal experience while avoiding spoilers as much as possible. [/i]  [b]Overall[/b], I found the game to be quite good. For someone who hasn't read the story of [b]Journey to the West[/b], I really enjoyed how it's presented here, especially the cinematics included in each chapter, I'll just say that if you appreciate animation as a medium of cinematic expression, you’ll likely enjoy them as well. I decided to purchase this game for two simple reasons: [b]Dragon Ball[/b] (inspired by Journey to the West) and [b]Elden Ring[/b]. The first one is my past, and the second is my present, and the surprise was quite pleasant. Although the game was heavily touted as being similar to the souls-like genre, I only noticed two aspects: the save points (similar to bonfires or graces) and the way some NPCs’ stories are told (characters who provide you with bits of information and whom you encounter repeatedly as you progress).  In terms of [b]gameplay[/b], Wukong is more akin to a [b]hack and slash[/b] than a souls-like, you could reference God of War and perhaps Sekiro, I mean its progression system is broad and accesible, it's frenetic, challenging, but above all, fun. What I didn’t like is the lack of a parry mechanic, there’s only one mechanic that rewards you for dodging at the right time. For me, the game’s strong point is the number and [b]variety of bosses[/b] (over 80), there’s only one boss that repeats in design, but not in its move set, which I greatly appreciate.  The world of Black Myth is unique and beautiful, with a different [b]map[/b] for each chapter. The downside is that at times it feels somewhat empty, I think they could have placed more difficult enemies or additional content in certain areas, as sometimes exploration doesn’t feel as rewarding.  The [b]music[/b] library is quite extensive and original, with over 70 tracks, most of which are very good. My personal recommendations are: [b]""Celestial Symphony"", ""Nonsense!"", ""If Good And Evil Gain No Due"", ""Flames Have Paved My Way”, ""Destiny"", ""It Was You"", ""Monkey Mind,"" ""The Greatest Yaoguai"", ""Where Lies The Path Ahead"",[/b] and especially [b][i]""Listen Not"".[/i][/b]  My [b]conclusion[/b], I [b]highly recommend[/b] this game if you're a fan of accessible hack and slash games, good graphics (which, for me, aren’t a major factor), animation, narrative that sometimes leaves out details, oriental ambient music, and above all, Chinese culture. However, [b] I do not recommend the Deluxe Edition[/b],the content is entirely in-game (like the music), and the items (weapons and armor) become completely obsolete after the first chapter.

0.596400499343872,english,"I wanted to like this game but after finishing it I was left thouroughly bored. Maybe I would have enjoyed the game if it was half as long but even then I have difficulty recommending it.  If you want a good action game then sure this will serve this purpose but you could also play one of the many other exceptional action games out there. It's functional and competently made but it never surprised me. Your moveset is rather limited, which prevents a great degree of player expression. But at the same time it is rarely challenging enough for aspects like the limited healing or stamina to matter. Boss designs are mostly forgettable and the ones that aren't forgettable also fail to stand out. If you aren't familiar with Chinese mythology your milage may vary, if you are nothing here will surprise you.  I found exploration to be mostly frustrating. It is unclear where you can go and where you will run up against an invisible wall. This would be fine if the game was a linear corridor without sidepaths ...but it is not. There are branching paths and open areas with some hidden locations containing items, bosses and some story relevant spots. This left me spending a decent chunk of this game running up against invisible walls in case there was a secret behind a ledge. The final chapter is also guilty of this issue for a separate reason I will not get into because of spoilers.   It also doest help that the game is a lot longer than it probably should have been. Especially chapter 3 drags on for way too long forcing you to fight repetitive enemies in an endless snowy forest.   Graphically BMW can look stunning but that comes at the cost of performance. The game is barely playable without resolution scaling and frame generation, but they add some pretty bad artifacts that are very noticable and distracting if you are sensitive to those. I am and those artifacts along with some oversharpening and lighting issues distracted me more than the graphics impressed.  I have read about 40% of Journey to the West a while back. If you haven't read the original, this story will just contain a series of seemingly random events. The game assumes that you are familiar with the original. Even while knowing certain story bits it was tough for me understanding what was happening at any moment and why.  Finally, and this hurts to say. Even though there is undoubtedly a ton of work and effort in here, this game didn't have any emotional peaks for me. Even the two final bosses that were probably intentioned to make me feel something left me feeling nothing. All else would have been forgiven if BMW delivered in some moment where it all came together but for whatever reason that never happened.   Your experience may differ but personally I cannot recommend spending 60-70€ on this game .",2803.0,2024-08-28 07:44:01,Not Recommended

0.5833333134651184,english,"I’ll review this game wearing two different hats. As a game designer, most of us unintentionally critique a game with our design hat on. So, here it is:  After a long time, a truly beautiful combat game has been released. The game is simply addictive—the feel, the combat, the sound of the staff’s impact, the voice acting—it’s all on point. But the most captivating part of the game is the BOSS FIGHTS! This game reignited my love for boss rushes, keeping me on my toes. One boss down, and here comes the next! In just 30 minutes of gameplay, I fought four bosses. The combat is perfection, like bread and butter.  As for the narrative, it feels cryptic at first, but if you pay a little attention, it’s beautifully presented. The game feels like a dance; more than just an Action RPG, it’s a rhythm game. You attack, watch, dodge, and attack again. Enemies have their own rhythm, and you counter them with your own. Now, the downside: exploration. As someone who loves to explore, this game is dangerous for me because it has no map, which leaves me feeling lost, wandering in circles. The organic design of the environments makes everything look similar. Overall, the game is a brilliant piece of art, challenging enough for everyone to enjoy well-designed bosses without being punishingly difficult—unlike some other games.  Design Perspective:  Putting on my design hat now, I’ve had conversations with peers who claim the game is shallow in its combat and exploration. At first, I kind of agreed, but after playing the game extensively, I realized that’s not entirely accurate. The statement comes from comparing this game to others like God of War, Devil May Cry, Ghost of Tsushima, or Nier Automata.  Wukong doesn’t have shallow combat; its depth is peak within its own territory. The game is perfection, with depth for both spammers and masters alike. Want to spam? Go ahead. Prefer to use nuanced parries, timing, and charged attacks? You can do that too. The game gives you the option to redo your abilities and try bosses with new strategies. Almost every upgrade is reversible, allowing you to play however you want.  As someone whose favorite combat game is Devil May Cry, I can confidently say that while DMC doesn’t force you to master combos to complete the game, Wukong does because of its nature. The enemies and bosses will wreck you, and that’s where the game shines. It forces you to adapt.  While God of War might have more depth, that’s a different game with different demands. Wukong doesn’t require that level of depth, but within its scope, it’s at its peak.  One major drawback, however, is the level design and visual clarity. The visuals aren’t clear enough to indicate whether an area is accessible. What looks like a climbable stone from afar turns out to be blocked by an invisible barrier when you get closer. The sense of direction in the game is practically non-existent, with no proper landmarks to help you understand where you are. The organic level design, while interconnected, can make navigation difficult, especially since you can sometimes reach areas without following the critical path. The only sure way to know you’re on the right track is to keep moving from boss to boss.  Conclusion:  Overall, after a long time, I’ve found a game that I look forward to playing after a long day of work. It challenges me just enough to keep me engaged without making me want to give up, unlike other games. And finally, let me emphasize: it’s not a Souls-like. Also, don’t give up at the big-headed mini-boss in the beginning!",3562.0,2024-08-29 19:07:31,Recommended
0.5833333134651184,english,"Review after 100%.  Visuals and Sounds: This game is genuinely one of the best-looking ARPGs I've played in recent years. The visuals and sounds are very immersive and detailed, the presentation was done so well that it would make me not want to progress but walk around, listen to the sound, and appreciate the details in the environment. Ghost of Tsushima was another one close to this level of stunning visuals but with a different artistic approach, it was beautiful in a way that's artificially enhanced to a point beyond realistic, but I don't feel that in BM:W, and honestly I prefer this art style more, not every piece of maps has to scream gorgeous, if the environment is to be mono-toned then it should be, that's what makes a game immersive. Even in mono-toned maps, because there are details everywhere, the game never felt boring to look at.   The music and sound effects in the game are overall very good, not something out of this world but very polished, I would feel the different atmosphere throughout the game, whether during exploration, cut-scene or a boss fight.  Combat: Combat is fluid and satisfying, there is no input action queue so you will need to pay attention to what your character is doing instead of just smashing buttons, which is fine otherwise the game would be too easy. Sometimes the input not registering in fights would get me killed but overall it's a very minor issue. This game also lacks a bit in the variety of weapon arts/moveset compared to similar games in this genre but overall it's still solid.   Gameplay: Boss variety is probably one of the best out there, no re-skinned clone and each encounter is a unique experience. Most of the boss designs are based on Chinese Mythology or Journey to the West with only very few exceptions, and it's such a treat to see how many were put in the game. The only issue for me was some of the bigger bosses' hitboxes were done poorly, mainly just Hundred-Eye, other than that they were all fun to fight against.    Difficulty-wise is on the easier side for those who's experienced in ARPG/Soulslike, close to God of War Balanced I would say. There were a few bosses that I felt over-tuned at first but later on, I realized it was intended for players to reminisce the experience of how Wukong fought those bosses with the help of different vessels in JTTW, which can be found in different secret areas in each map. Some might find it a ridiculous design but the story and exploration in those secret areas was probably one of my favorite things about this game since they were the original JTTW timeline and brought back so many memories.   One of the issues people mentioned was no map in this game, it didn't bother me that much besides chapter 3, as soon as I found out the torches/braziers were the guide it became much less of an issue. There are invisible walls throughout the game that they could've done a better job indicating, but it's not an issue that I run into often enough that's ruining the experience, it's not an open-world after all so walls should be expected.  I have only had 2 crashes throughout the entire time I played, one at the beginning of the game right after the intro cut-scene, and 1 crash during the game when I was surrounded by a ton of mobs that shot different things at me. Overall performance was good except for the final chapter where I noticed a bit of performance drop, but also expected given the map design essentially forces you to render the entire map.  Story: The story could be a bit confusing for those who are not familiar with JTTW, we play as the destined one, and as we embark on our journey to retrieve Wukong's six indriyas/sense-organs, we meet different characters that show different states of mental torment of our human nature, our greed, aversion, ignorance, pride, and jealousy. I think some of the philosophical ideas in the game around Buddhism and human nature are not only very hard to translate, but were also presented in an obscure way. It's not something to critic as everyone has different taste when it comes to mysterious lore, nonetheless, I think it still did a fantastic job at depicting some of the stories from JTTW throughout the game with all the different side quests.   The quality of the cinematic and animation throughout the game is also insane, if you haven't read JTTW you will be missing out on the context but regardless it's still amazing to watch even if you have no idea what's going on.  Verdict: It is by no means perfect, but despite its flaws, it's still a great and unique experience and I enjoyed it, if you like ARPGs then it's worth trying.",4632.0,2024-08-28 11:08:59,Recommended

0.5634920597076416,english,"This is my first game review ever.  Personally, I find it to be an excellent game and highly recommend it to friends. After investing a total of 7X7=49 hours, I have finally met the conditions to unlock so-far all endings. Reflecting on this time, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute and every second, regardless of whether I was able to defeat the boss or the nature of the narrative content I encountered. Of course, I particularly look forward to seeing a more expansive or even revolutionary breaking-free-from-the-confines-of-Samsara narrative in potential future DLCs or other installments in the series.  The game is imbued with an immense amount of beauty that is unique to local culture, a profound romanticism inherent to our heritage, and elements of philosophical thought integrating Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism. The content and details of this game are not something that many people can fully comprehend and absorb, and cannot be quickly grasped in a fast-food, superficial manner. It could be the same even to many contemporary local individuals, including myself, who have received predominantly Western science-and-technology-focused education with only a certain amount of exposure to the local and traditional classics, arts, and humanities. Drawing a parallel with language learning, the understanding and learning costs associated with different cultures vary significantly. Therefore, when we see low ratings or negative reviews, to some extent, it is inevitable. After all, these ratings and feedback could be based on the limited or even complete lack of understanding of a culture with a profound and continuous historical background. Whether the reviewers are merely playing the game casually, their lack of understanding of the cultural core, narrative structure, and the deeper meanings within the dialogues leads to evaluations based solely on their gameplay experiences, such as defeating bosses and achieving victories without understanding the meaning of the dialog/background story; or some other reasons you may or may not know. Regarding these reviews, there is no point in arguing. Individuals are at various stages of understanding the way of meaning, and acquiring knowledge in any field involves a learning curve. Just like an old saying from a story from <The Record of Pointing at the Moon, Vol. 28>: Firstly, to perceive the game as simply a game; then, to recognize that the game is not merely a game; and finally, to understand that the game is indeed the game.  It must be aware that classical culture requires outstanding contemporary works to bridge cultural gaps and foster global-and-glocal understanding. I genuinely hope that our local game developers can produce more and better works for the world, as our predecessors have achieved much more challenging feats. Certainly, regarding the Game Science firm itself, I look forward to DLCs related to our beloved Wukong and new installments in this series.   This game is truly remarkable.",2993.0,2024-08-29 18:00:30,Recommended

Got the intro Bug were wukong is just stuck there standing with nothing moving but the wind and trees. Closed the game opened it back up everything was fine studdering like crazy  got to the titan part everything loaded fine but the clouds you are suppose to be standing on arent there so you literally see straight through everything from the floor down. Closed the game re opened it up same issue continued on got to the forest section everything ran fine start the game up the next day after looking for a fix for the prologue the whole forest section is completly bugged and textures and everything dont load in at all.  This game needs many many many patches in the 1st 2 hours I had way to many bugs for a AAA game thats been in development for years, There is no reason why I should be getting texture streaming issues I have this game downloaded on a NVME drive using direct storage, other issues this game has no ""pre"" shader compiler you either have to use -dx11 in the launch options or just keep opening and closing the game but this game has denovo so if you do it too many times you get locked out, other issues  Menu for me was bugged as well couldnt turn on RTX even though im on a RTX 3090 with updated drivers my nividia experience said it was on but it wasnt,  if your on a AMD gpu your screwed since this game doesnt play nice with them at all so you will either get the intro crash bug or your game wont start at all Missing textures like I said before Textures not loading which is the same issue on ps5 as well. Input lag is atrocious during certain sections. FPS will go from 120+ to 10 fps in various boss fights chapter 3 is bugged. Huge memory leak issues the more you play the game worst than BG3 at launch by far cant compile sharers manually. constant stuttering and lag that made it nearly unplayable at times.  Very disappointing I would give this game a 5/10 at best in its current state terrible ps5 version is even worst, And there are no fixes for any of this issues people said just verify files did it 5 times did nothing still had all these issues this game needs to FORCE a shader compile run before you even start the game Street fighter, Tekken, and many other Japanese and US made games do this there is no reason this game shouldnt have the bare minimum applied.",2472.0,2024-08-28 05:20:56,Not Recommended

0.5561490654945374,english,"This game was bit of a let down after seeing a lot of hype.   The combat feels like a sloppy version of a 'souls like' with weird hit boxes and extremely limited options on how you wish to fight. The game is very linear pushing you from one boss to another, you fight each one with a loadout the game wants you to have, there is no variety, there is no choice beyond the talents. You pickup the minimal items between bosses and that's it. It becomes a stale boss grind extremely quickly with very little else to it. Boss -> few npcs, 2/3 items on ground - > Boss -> few npcs, 2/3 items on ground - > Boss etc, repeat for entire game. What I enjoy in souls games is that you can go to X location for this weapon and Y location for this armour to make a build fun, you can grind stats to do specific things, wield specific items, whereas wukong has none of this.  The game looks nice, the graphics are very good but performance is not brilliant with quite a few areas causing stuttering or lag however this type of issue will likely be patched out in the future so i don't give that much weight in my overall opinion.   I would give this game maybe a 6/10, it was fun for a few hours but got stale very quickly even when progressing rapidly through bosses. I haven't felt compelled to go back and play more at any point, the game hasn't drawn me in at all, in fact thinking about the cost it feels very meh for what i paid.

0.5471020936965942,english,"  So I'm writing down points as I'm playing the game. Here will be my thoughts:    These RPG games are my favourite. These are the only games that keep me interested and that I love.  This game has cool bosses and a high amount of them. The gameplay when fighting is good, but similar no matter what skills you have. Cool ideas, cool transformations, cool feeling when you hit one of those big hits.  Final boss is amazing. That is how most of the big bosses SHOULD have been.    Now here is what I very much dislike about the game (Not worth 60 Euros for me):    0. Story: What story? There is no depth, no passion, nothing really interesting and it does not even go anywhere. You spend the entire game not continuing the story that is presented in the beginning. I guess this is a setup for a second game? Or did we just forget about the entire story?  0.1 Why do I feel like skipping most cut-scenes? They are not really interesting or good, besides a couple of them  0.2 I don't care about any character in the game....even the main character you play, has no soul....no value, you're just a vessel for the actual protagonist that you for no reason look exactly like    1. INVISIBLE WALLS? The map is sooo hard to navigate because of these random invisible walls and prebuilt assets generated randomly . There are invisible walls when fighting bosses in an EMPTY FIELD! There's nothing there but you get stuck in an invisible wall.....  2. Can't climb anything...  3. Graphics on CINEMATIC are not good enough, not as expected for a 5 years in development game...for 45 hours of mediocre gameplay?  4. There are other souls like, OR Action RPG games better than this or on par, some of them on Games Pass. I advise those.  5. People inevitably compare it to elden ring, dark souls or Sekiro, because of the genre the devs put it in and some similar mechanics. However, this does not deserve to be in the same sentence. You can get over 1000 hours in elden ring, but here a max of 45 and you're quite done. And Sekiro? Well even if that's a short game as well, it's quite a masterpiece, there is no comparison.  6. Bosses are cool... but quite easy so you don't get to enjoy them much, there are too many methods you can dodge and became invulnerable or untargetable. Last boss is the only one I'll remember and the only one that deserves it. All other enemies than bosses are weak  6.1 OH MY GOD! - There are quite a few bosses in the game that just keep moving and flying everywhere, out of bounds and of my screen, I just keep running and trying to get to them and they keep doing random moves, unthinkable making no sense whatsoever moves and it's just sooo cumbersome... this is a chore. I actually recorded a boss fight and out of 20 minutes of the fight, 15 of them the boss was flying, being untargetable.. and 5 minutes was doing weird random moves that make no sense.  7. All zones feel like stock regions pre-programmed and just used here with a little bit of Chinese flavour.  8. Character customizability is weak: Barely customize the weapon... not much difference in weapons just very similar moveset you will play with for the entire game. Armour customizability just mediocre as well  9. All zones feel empty and just a path with random mobs, no soul, no other characters in the game feel good...none are interesting, all are basic stock characters.  10. Rewards from chests: Incredibly boring pieces of gold that you sell right away.  11. No danger whatsoever: You don't lose anything when you die, it's just annoying that you have to walk the road back....  12. ""RPG""? Where? You can get pretty much all skill points as you play, there is barely any ""build"", or ""customizability"", and it is all very similar. This would have been a great game in 2010  13. No stealth or alternate way to play the game. No alternate paths, nothing interesting you can really do but march forward and kill stuff. Everything connects at the end anyways...for no reason  14. No reason to replay the game at all. No replayability  15. The game sounds like I'm playing a stuffed animal all day long with the monkey sounds.....  16. No exploration whatsoever: Found something interesting?? An invisible wall... At best you find 3 bells that take you to a secret boss...welp..  17. Abilities and skills are average at best. Transformations are somewhat cool  18. So many attacks and skills do not connect and do not hit their target... from regular attacks that go straight through the boss without hitting to even homing spells just don't work, to jump attacks where you bug above the boss and don't hit a homing attack....  19. Game edge boundaries? 80% of the game you cannot jump off of cliffs or fall. 20% however, randomly, you can jump off of that cliff, or fall. So you have to hit every place around you to see if you can actually walk over there or an invis wall stops you. There are even doors built into the game that are open but you cannot go through....  20. The multiple staff stances are useless...you just pick one and stick with it. At the end even they said fck it and gave you all stances that would randomly happen when you attack....  21. So many weapons and armour effects throw words at you about ""spirit skills"", and different other abilities or passives but don't show you what those actually are. You have to go back reading through each skill to see if you can even find the object of discussion and most of the times you cannot and need to search it. Pls take a page from Baldur's gate 3, when you inspect anything, the underlined words actually tell you what they do. Why even underline those words in this game if you don't have an explanation to them?  22. Every upgrade or medicine material have such random names and they are so many for no reason that you never know what they are for. You have to go through all the vendors, all the menus and inventory and choices every 30 minutes to find out what you can upgrade at a given moment...  23. Most of the armours are irelevant and their bonuses are next to useless, fights feel similar with no matter what armour set you have. Last boss might require a decent build only...  24. The open world Mount Huaguo... Later on you get to this open space for the first time in the game and thank God the developers didn't develop an actually open world RPG game because this is a mess... Big open space almost empty with some arenas where you'll get to fight some bosses. The catch? You have to spend a lot of time flying around and hopefully find these bosses AND the biggest mistake is that even if this is an open world area, you still have to do things in an EXACT order, otherwise the story won't move forward. So I explored...silly me, because I quickly found later places where nothing happened, and I spent so much time trying to figure out why... Turns out, that I had to do other things in an exact order before, for an action to trigger in the places I initially found.... lots of time wasted flying around a stock map that was already pre-built in the game engine....lovely, I can feel the... ""passion""? the devs put into this? Still you kill all the bosses in max 2 tries and they are all quite forgettable....  25. How is it that I remember all the bosses of the Dark Souls games, Sekiro, Elden Ring....but I remember maybe 1 boss of this game?... There are a lot of them, some quite interesting, but somehow they managed to make everything forgettable... I don't remember almost any region of the game either.... I think there was a lava region...and this weird open space",7559.0,2024-08-30 14:47:05,Not Recommended
0.5459181666374207,english,"After clearing a stage 4.5 hours in I feel like there is a big ""something"" missing from the combat.    It's quite disappointing as the rest of the game looks and feels excellent, from the story telling choices and the UI's.  But combat being the main aspect of the game I can't really bring myself to play any further than the Electric Frog Boss very early in the second Chapter.    I feel like there is no impact when striking my opponents, the peons are very weak and die too quickly to get that satisfying final hit during the combo but it feels like a waste to use a fully charged heavy to quickly dispatch them with that satisfying smack.    When fighting a boss I feel like I'm a flea using CQC on an Ox. I'm relying on my cool-downs to rinse and repeat every single time and after a few too many encounters I can feel the repetitive nature scratching away at my brain.  I really wanted to like this game as it IS beautiful the illustrations, the effort in the descriptions of the Yaoguai is insane.    I don't know if this is me being picky... but the very obvious invisible walls seems a tad lazy for the quality we see in many areas. I feel like this is an example of ""Being a mile wide but an inch deep"" when it comes to their level design. UE5 is beautiful but it isn't a crutch.  I know it's not an open world game but I'd like some creativity when it comes to blocking my path.

When it got released I had no intention of checking it out, but the amount of hype and news surrounding it made me buy the game 2 days after release thinking ""if it's bad I'll just refund"". After playing through just the intro, I decided it wasn't getting refunded no matter what.  In recent years, the gaming landscape feels crowded with sequels, reboots, remasters, remakes, uninspired and unoriginal crap close to or straight up plagiarism and potential successes plagued by performance/compatibility issues and terrible practices like microtransactions, lootboxes, live service models, focus on meeting marketing deadlines instead of delivering finished and polished games, etc. It's been so hard to find something to play that I recently loaded up Far Cry 6 just so I could mindlessly shoot things while having some laughs with my friends about how bad the game is (while still managing to be more fun than most other modern games).  For me, Black Myth: Wukong stands out as a refreshing entry in the industry, as an action/adventure game with hack and slash combat that punishes you if you attempt to just button mash, blending elements of souslike while having actual lore, cinematic cutscenes and being accessible to casual players, and presenting us with a story rooted in Chinese mythology that we haven't seen before in any large game and is unknown to many westerners, very different from the usual hero against villain we've grown used to.  I should say in advance that this game is far from perfect, and it's also not unique in any way (aside from being the first AAA from China). Why then is it highly and widely praised, already among my favorite games of all time and deserving of the Game of the Year award? I think it's because it excels in almost every single aspect, and it's also one of the few recent AAA games that really feels polished and finished on launch. It isn't trying to copy anything, it isn't trying to be something it isn't, there is no unnecessary stuff that makes you think ""why is this even in the game?"".  The storytelling is immersive, with amazing voice acting (at least in English and Chinese). At first it looks like the classic journey of growth and redemption after the hero's downfall, but you soon realize it is told in a more darker and natural tone, with your character having it's flaws pointed out and frowned upon constantly both by your opponents and allies. You're not the typical hero [spoiler] (heck, you're not even the Monkey King, you're just a monkey which might be destined to fulfill Sun Wukong's path, and depending on your actions during the game you fail and the cycle just continues until another monkey is able to complete the journey). [/spoiler] At the end of each chapter you get a cutscene, some look like modern animes, some look like something from Studio Ghibli, and some are claymation, which gives a nice touch to the story.  The graphics are simply amazing, it's one of the best looking games out there along with Alan Wake 2 and Senua's Saga: Hellblade II. Full Ray Tracing is amazingly implemented, and so are the upscaling technologies. Performance is surprisingly stable and optimized. For some reason it's missing proper HDR support, making some areas burn your retina with excessive brightness while other areas are pitch dark. I've seen a lot of people complaining about the forced DOF and low-res textures blended in the high-res world. While I'm against the lack of customizable options, i think the DOF in this game could be perfect if toned down just a bit, and even the low-res textures have a place in the game, since it creates a sense of depth in the scene. You can easily recognize what is playable ground and what is just filling the scenario, you can differentiate between important places and places you can't even reach, and if everything had the same amount of detail the world would just be a overly sharp mess.  The level design is the only weak point in my opinion, but I'm used to FromSoftware games, so that's tough competition, and I don't know how it compares to similar games in the genre since I don't usually play them. The world is beautifully crafted, but you can't explore it that much. I don't mind the invisible walls since it's not an open world game, but they could definitely be better placed. The chapters are pretty linear, sometimes you will be offered at most two different paths, but these paths loop around and lead you to the same place in the end.  Soundtrack is good, sometimes you don't pay much attention to it, sometimes it enhances the atmosphere, and sometimes it completely steals the show like [spoiler] the Headless Monk in Chapter 2, the Yaksha King fight, the moments leading up to obtaining Jingubang in the cave, The Great Sage's Broken Shell fight, etc. [/spoiler]  The gameplay is fluid, with a challenging but fair difficulty. The combat is dynamic and fast paced, but you still have to pay attention to your resources and the enemies actions. There are a lot of unlockable skills, three different staff instances that serve different purposes, a few spells that require planning to use or you just waste your mana and cooldowns, different equipments that can alter your playstyle, and consumables that can give you the edge in a battle when you feel the boss is simply stronger than you. Removing the staff throw was a bad decision since we're left with zero ranged attacks.  The game has a nice pace, at no point I felt tired, bored, or stuck. The narrative is layered and ensures you stay invested throughout the whole thing. I wasn't familiar at all with Journey to the West (aside from the Monkey King character), but now I feel like consuming more media related to it. The game has 2 endings, and I find both are perfect. [spoiler] The first one (called the Bad Ending) is the default one and has the player monkey character fight the Stone Monkey and The Great Sage's Broken Shell (which are the mindless and spiritless body of the original Sun Wukong), only to find out you accomplished the same success but also the same failures, having the golden headband fitted in your head and taking the broken shell's place, awaiting until the true destined monkey fulfills Sun Wukong's destiny. The second ending (called the True Ending) requires you to complete a lot of optional tasks and fight Erlang, which is presented in the very first scene of the game as an archnemesis, and as a result you unveil some truths about both his intentions and Sun Wukong's actions. The monkey recovers all of Sun Wukong's memories, and ends up rejecting the golden headband, finally uniting all of the six relics and proving to be indeed the Destined One, rising again as Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, and leaving room for an expasion or a second game. [/spoiler]  Black Myth: Wukong somehow managed to surpass it's expectations which were already extremely high, and it should set a new benchmark for future games in the genre. Shoutout to the developers who started it as a passion project and made their first public showcase as a means of attracting more people to the team instead of trying to sell an unfinished product.

0.5454545617103576,english,"Story: Nothing really that strong here when it comes to the story. You play as a monkey and look for the six parts of Sun Wukong’s spirit when it split. You don’t really know why you’re doing it, and characters don’t explain why. I’m not sure if the characters even know why. The story is as linear as it can get, but the lore is interesting. Characters pop in from time to time to give you an ability then they disappear. All linear and very straightforward. Not one of the strengths of this game.  Graphics and environment: Some of the best graphics in this game. My set-up could run the game decently in High settings and it still looked great. As for the environments, this is where it gets frustrating. You can’t access places you think you can. There is no map, so you might get lost or forget what you were doing the last time before you died. Especially if you get far. I spent a lot of time just walking around in circles and trying to get in places you’re not allowed to.  Gameplay: This is where the game shines the most. It excels with so many varied combos, skills and spells. If you master it, you become unstoppable and can sometimes beat bosses in the first try. The bosses are well-designed and unique. Some of them are really difficult. The customization is there, but it is limited to just after you beat some bosses. Some armor sets look great.  Overall, this is a phenomenal game so far and I recommend it to anyone who likes GOW, Sekiro, Dark Souls, and any of their ilk.  Ridiculously overpowered  main and optional bosses that are almost invincible with buffs in a list longer than my d*ck. F*ck this game 10/10 ",1636.0,2024-08-30 20:08:07,Recommended

0.5454545617103576,english,"After finishing the game with 100% of achievements, I can definitely say that the game lives up to the hype and I highly recommend playing this game. Of course, there are a few flaws that I shall mention, but overall I've had a great time playing. It looks amazing, the combat is fun and smooth and the story managed to get me emotional at certain points. My final score for this game is 9/10.  Regarding performance, I had to play on medium settings, since I ran the game with an i7-6700 processor, 16 GB RAM and a Nvidia Geforce GTX 1070 graphics card, which is far from ideal. But with the right settings, the game ran smoothly most of the time and even on medium settings it still looks quite good. I've only had one crash on day 1 and a bit of stuttering during the prologue. Other than that, there were no issues.   The story takes place after the events from Journey to the West. I won't spoil the events that take place in the game, but at the end of each chapter we get cutscenes related to the story of that chapter, each one being done in a different animation style. Also, there are different endings to the game.   The path we follow in the game is, for the most part, quite linear, but it has enough branching paths and secret areas so it doesn't feel boring, or like we are stuck on rails. The environments we explore over the course of the game are quite varied, ranging from forests, deserts, frozen lakes and mountains, labyrinthine caves, volcanic mountains.  Regarding exploration, I've seen some people complaining about the lack of a map, but personally I haven't felt lost or like I would have required help orienting myself, perhaps with the exception of the final chapter, that takes place in an open area.  My biggest complaint about exploration and navigation is that there are invisible walls (which is understandable, since it's not an open world), but sometimes it's difficult to tell if something is inaccessible or the path to a potential secret area. When in doubt, just bonk all the fences I guess. But other than this, I've had no issues with this part of the game.  The game is an Action RPG, with challenging combat (still, it feels a lot easier than a souls-like in my opinion) and plenty of bosses to fight. There are, in fact, over 90 different bosses and mini bosses that we can encounter in the game and they have different looks and move sets (yes, there are few frog bosses that only differ through their elemental type, but even fighting those is worth it in the end), so combat will not get stale.   By doing the secret areas in each chapter, you get an item that can make the final boss of said chapter a lot easier. For example, gain flame immunity against the first one, or cancel one of their abilities. Of course acquiring these items and using them is optional, so if you prefer a harder encounter, you still have that option.  Regarding combat, it is fluid and responsive, with light/heavy attacks and combos, three stances, transformations and varied spells. The skill tree is generous with its options and re-allocating skill points is free, so experimenting with different builds is encouraged.  Stats and resistances can be boosted through alchemy after you meet a certain character and you can reallocate these points whenever you want. Armor sets give certain bonuses which buff various play styles. Equipment progression is mostly linear, at least to a certain point where you gain the option to upgrade older sets of armor, which allows you to continue using the bonuses you prefer. There is only one weapon type, the staff, but there are spears that can be obtained and they have a somewhat different move set. The mini bosses we fight can be absorbed and used in combat, each one gives a passive buff and a brief transformation that executes their signature attack.  Now, regarding my [b]main issues[/b] with the game...  As I've said above, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether  you will hit an invisible wall or start down hidden path. Chapter 4 in particular has a lot of secret content that can be accidentally missed, which can be quite frustrating if you are a completionist. The game requires playing through NG+ anyway if you want to 100%, so I guess it's not that much of an issue, but it's still annoying. For example, to unlock the secret area (that contains missable stuff too, of course), you need to fight an optional boss twice. But during the first encounter, that boss can drop a piece of armor that is needed for the achievement. It only drops that item IF you attack it from behind and break 4 of its arms. If you accidentally kill the boss before that, you are unable to obtain the item in that playthrough. And the final complaint, which again matters only if you want to 100%: the drop rates for seeds and armor pieces are a bit too low in my opinion. Sure, it depends on RNG and luck, but I spent 2 full days trying to farm the last type of seed I needed for the [Seed to Sow] achievement. And that is while wearing the items that boost drop rates too. And for this reason alone I give it a 9/10 instead of a 9.5/10 like it would otherwise deserve.",5139.0,2024-08-30 01:33:14,Recommended

0.5454545617103576,english,"As a Chinese, after playing through Black Myth: Wukong, I have a few suggestions for those interested in its story line and cultural elements: first of all, do not try to understand all the elements in the game, its fking impossible. i.e., monsters(yaoguai) could quote Confucius(Decayed wood cannot be carved), etc.  2. Don't start by reading the novel Journey to the West; it's long and challenging to understand. It  incorporates a lot of Chinese philosophical thought (such as Buddhist and Taoist ideas) and can be interpreted from many angles including political and cultural perspectives, each offering a completely different yet plausible explanation. If you want to quickly understand Journey to the West, just watch the 1986 TV series by the same name. After watching it, playing the game will give you a completely different experience.   3. Chinese language tends to be implicit. Simply put, it's often indirect, this tend to happens in a collectivist society, especially China. For example, highly-rated Chinese dramas often involve a lot of implicit expression, meaning they don't directly state viewpoints or phenomena(you have to analyze the hided meaning behind the script). House of Cards as a US drama, fits well with what I consider a typical preference among Chinese people. So, when playing the game or watching the show, you might try to analyze the logic and motives behind each sentence.  I'll give a hint here:  [spoiler] you may find that some monsters knows Wukong had a position in the ""haven"", this type of monster usually call Wukong ""horses keeper/protector""(Wukong was assigned a job alike cowboy(horse-boy) in haven), when they call Wukong horseboy, Wukong usually wont fight em directly. instead, Wukong will try find some help from haven(to see who is the ""owner"" or ""master"" of the monster), eventually, the monster will back to the haven. however, the ending of most monsters without background is DEATH.

0.5454545617103576,english,"Black Myth: Wukong is an action game with fundamental gameplay balancing problems but that pales in comparison to the amount, scale and sheer quality of content that it has to offer. You can so easily tell that they spent years developing this game tirelessly to deliver what is basically the biggest triple A action game ever made in history.  𝗜𝘀 𝗶𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗵 𝗯𝘂𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴?  Now if you are only interested in the verdict: It is worth the money, This game boasts a grand total of 113 bosses spanning over 6 chapters of story and while of course I could trim down all the glorified elites/one-off weird gimmicks it would easily still boil down to at least 60 “real” bosses and that is absolutely incredible when you compare it with other games in the genre. I think both casual and hardcore players can find a ton of enjoyment because the game offers you a lot of ways to reduce/increase the difficulty.   𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆  The story is actually not a reimagined adaptation of Journey to the West but it’s an imagining of a follow-up/sequel to it, centering around the mission of resurrecting Wukong centuries after his defeat. If you are a fan of the original work, it is an absolute feast of references since throughout the campaign you’d be meeting friends and foes that Wukong encountered during his original journey.   𝗩𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹𝘀  I wouldn’t say the “dark” tone of the game doesn’t match the vibe of the original myth because as per usual with Asian myths they are very edgy anyway but I would have loved if the game was more vibrant in visuals. One of my first complaints in my first impressions was that the art direction is lacking and I still feel like this is somewhat true by the end of the game, for the environment at least. The world looks too realistic for its own good most of the time, creating really bland landscapes that only really captivate the eyes thanks to UE5’s graphical fidelity.   This disappointment in art direction only extends to environmental design however, as the game’s incredibly diverse array of enemies absolutely do not disappoint. When I played Lies of P last year, it kind of pushed the boundary for enemy variety for this kind of games, but Wukong probably does it even better. There are monsters from every kind of abomination category imaginable, each with their own lore, and the designs on both the bosses and the enemies are absolutely top notch, showcasing both the core features from their original myth while also animated super well. The insect enemies in particular are absolute disgusting and this is to the game’s benefits, the effort they spend on animating the wiggling limbs to create the arachnid feeling makes them phenomenally terrifying. I genuinely think people who have actual arachnophobia will get panic attacks playing Chapter 4, a testament to how good the choreography and animation are.  𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻  Level design, however, is an aspect that can sour the experience sometimes. The game is too obsessed with trying to make complicated levels it just ends up being confusing, because once you have taken a branching path, it is incredibly difficult to find your bearings back to where you were without being constantly paranoid and check corners every 5 seconds. This is similar to Team Ninja games where there is a deliberate effort to make the levels not boring straight hallways but it ends up making the exploration annoying because there are too many paths to take at once. Good level design is when they do this and intentionally lead the players back to where they were but is it seldom seen in this game, where more often than not, dead ends await you. That being said, I think the only part of the game that’s severely affected by this is Chapter 3 with the prison and snow area, for the others it is way less egregious due to the breakneck pacing of constant boss fights.  𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗯𝗮𝘁  Now I have to talk about the game’s fundamental balancing issue that I mentioned at the beginning and also boss fights at the same time. I LOVE the bosses in this game (the “real” ones that is, not some random cart that breathes fire), there is an insurmountable amount of effort put into designing the movesets with a lot nuances/switch-ups to keep you on your toes. The variety of attacks is worth mentioning especially, on par with something like the recently released Elden Ring DLC. The boss quality keeps ramping up towards the later half of the game too, like don’t get me wrong there are still many stinkers here and there but there are so many memorable ones.  Then what is the balancing issue? This game’s difficulty is all over the place. You are given a set of tools to assist with combat but most of them feel like cheat, which, don’t get me wrong, fit Wukong perfectly as the mischievous warrior but does it dumb down the game so much if you actually make use of them. There are just so many ways in this game you can make the bosses stagger and I’m for sure not a big fan of it, this is also one of the main reasons why a lot of people don’t consider this game a Souls-like because the difficulty certainly isn’t up to par. But then we also have bosses that are actually balanced around all these tools with their narrow windows of punishing and they feel extremely good to fight since you don’t have to hold back, which makes me wish that the rest of the game was balanced in the same manner. I have to intentionally hold back most of the time in order to make the bosses threatening and this is not something you want players to feel, I just want to be able to do all the cool shit without feel like I’m breaking the game in half. That being said, I am 100% doing a playthrough that excludes all magic and I think it would be both drastically different and also much more fun.   ---------------------------------------------------  Regardless of all that this game is just so. fucking. cool. Unfathomably badass, not in the silly wacky DMC way but it just makes you feel good. Attacking, parrying and dodging all feel super satisfying. There are so many satisfying secrets to find, with each chapter having its own Souls DLC-esque optional area. Bosses will have a variety of voice lines than react to what you do and numerous special interactions with certain items that reward lore-attentive players. The cinematic setpieces are unapologetically badass without being intrusive to gameplay. Even though the storytelling didn’t get me at first it gets a lot better after the first chapter and it’s like the perfect mix between the cryptic background lore-heavy element of Souls games and the usual cinematic kind of story. There’s an animated shorts at the end of every chapter with each of them having a different animation style and they all were awesome.  As an all-round product this is easily the best contender for Game of the Year this year and I can’t imagine anything topping it. Absolutely amazing game. First impressions weren’t too kind but as the game got more expansive and I got used to the gameplay while learning how to restrict myself to have fun, I ended up having such a blast.",7050.0,2024-08-29 14:58:22,Recommended
0.5454545617103576,english,"Black Myth: Wukong is a visual spectacle, with stunning graphics and intricate details in both character design and environments. From the finely crafted clothing to the richly textured backgrounds, every frame looks like a piece of art. However, this visual fidelity does come with performance challenges; many players have reported struggling to run the game smoothly. I experienced a few minor frame stutters, but these cleared up after updating my graphics driver. Nonetheless, it's something prospective players should keep in mind. On a positive note, the option to skip every cutscene is a welcome feature, allowing the game’s pace to remain brisk and player-focused.  However, the game’s attention to environmental detail has a downside. The world often feels overly busy, making navigation difficult. This is especially true in larger, open areas where it’s easy to get lost without clear landmarks. Invisible walls also impede exploration, frequently blocking areas that appear accessible, which can feel frustrating and disrupt immersion. The lack of verticality compounds these issues; ranged enemies perched above are tough to reach, requiring players to hunt for the specific path that allows access. Additionally, enemies sometimes fall through these invisible barriers, breaking immersion and forcing players to awkwardly pursue them. There’s also a lot of straightforward running between content, and backtracking to old areas for quests or items quickly becomes a repetitive chore.  Combat in Black Myth: Wukong is both rewarding and frustrating. The core combat revolves around light attack combo strings with up to five hits, but long attack animations can leave players vulnerable, locking them into place. Dodging is the primary defensive option, but it must be timed after attack animations, making it challenging to avoid incoming damage. Heavy attacks, unlocked through a Focus meter, deal significant damage but can be difficult to land, especially against larger enemies. The targeting system often locks onto specific parts of a boss, making it easy to miss fully charged attacks, especially as enemies grow in size. A secondary resource, Qi, allows players to replicate powerful attacks from defeated bosses, adding variety and utility, particularly for applying status effects.  Magic is another major component of combat, with spells offering powerful but limited-use abilities. Spells have long cooldowns and consume mana, which cannot be replenished during fights, making each cast a strategic decision. They range from freezing enemies to setting up attacks, to transforming into unique characters with their own movesets. The most interesting is a spell that creates clones of the player, adding layers of chaos and opportunity in battle. As the game progresses, these magical abilities expand significantly, offering players more creative ways to approach combat.  The gear system in Black Myth: Wukong is one of the game’s strengths, providing engaging choices that affect playstyle. Resources for crafting are automatically collected from defeated enemies, allowing players to continuously upgrade to new gear sets that feature unique thematic bonuses. Armor sets aren’t just about increasing stats; each piece offers situational perks that encourage experimentation, such as increased power when near water or bonus damage after sprinting. These bonuses help keep the gameplay dynamic and allow players to tailor their approach to different encounters.  Customization extends beyond gear, with an extensive skill system that lets players modify nearly every aspect of their abilities. Skill points can be invested to alter spells, attacks, and defensive moves, and can be reset at any rest point, encouraging players to experiment freely. Additionally, the game’s non-linear progression lets players explore different paths, offering an alternative if a specific boss proves too challenging. This flexibility helps mitigate frustration, especially with the sheer number of bosses—over 80—spread throughout the game.  However, there are notable design missteps, particularly in later chapters. Many chapter bosses are exceedingly difficult unless players find secret quests that provide game-changing items. These secrets are often so well-hidden that guides are practically necessary, which can alienate those who miss them. From Chapter 5 onward, the game’s encounters start to feel repetitive, with several bosses sharing similar, limited movesets, creating a sense of padding. Paired boss fights lack the excitement of earlier one-on-one encounters, and Chapter 6’s vast, empty spaces feel more like a scavenger hunt than meaningful exploration. One particularly tedious boss in Chapter 6 requires the player to hold an activation button, with unclear prompts on where to stand, making the fight feel more like a chore than a challenge.  The final boss is a particular low point, feeling disproportionately difficult compared to anything that precedes it. This encounter is plagued by excessive evasiveness, drawn-out combos, and unskippable mid-fight cutscenes that drag down the pacing. Invisible walls around the arena further complicate dodging, making it an infuriating test of patience rather than skill. The difficulty spike feels unfair, and I suspect many players may quit the game out of frustration rather than push through to the end.  Overall, Black Myth: Wukong offers a visually stunning world and deep combat mechanics that reward exploration and experimentation. However, inconsistent design choices, performance issues, and frustrating moments—particularly in the later stages—hinder the overall experience. It's a game that shows immense promise but stumbles in its execution, especially for those unprepared for its sudden shifts in difficulty and pacing.",5817.0,2024-08-29 09:40:31,Recommended

0.9297295212745667,schinese,“好玩”这二字就是对一款游戏的最高评价。62小时一周目，靠自己探索完成了60个成就，看攻略打出真结局，我想我有资格给出它正面的评价。我不明白为何国内舆论环境如此糟糕，为了抹黑已经开始虚空捏造不存在的剧情套在这款游戏上，而且越传越离谱。我到现在也没搞懂那些造谣的组织是为了什么，也许我们就没有让好游戏存活的土壤，这让我对中国未来单机游戏行业前景感到悲观。,176.0,2024-08-31 18:07:19,Recommended
0.9217209219932556,schinese,2024.9.4更新： 当我看到网上关于《战争艺术：赤潮》的剧情设定的介绍后，对于本作的剧情短板，我已经大彻大悟，释然并和解了。虽然关于《西游记》部分的评价依旧——亲子鉴定结果出来了，“红孩儿”终于知道了自己的身世，《西游记》不用当接盘侠了。游戏本身无疑是佳作的，有道是“不疯魔不成活”，我相信毕竟没有对过去“袈裟”的这些执念，说不定他们真的带不来《黑神话：悟空》的横空出世。只是有些人的执念是袈裟、有人是学姐、有人是亡妻、有人是晶晶……就像我中学作文里总是会引用我喜欢的歌词、作家，贴合主题是次要的，为了我的执念才是真正原因。  原测评： 截止前天（2024/8/26），我已经通关了《黑神话：悟空》一周目，为了保障个人游玩体验，在这七天时间内，我是屏蔽一切攻略的，几乎是完全凭自己探索，好在玩的还算细致，虽然没有全收集，但也自认为可以好好谈一谈这一游戏了。 首先是关于优化方面，因为手头这台笔记本电脑购买于四年前，显卡只是GTX1650，所以发售首日我先借用了朋友40系显卡的电脑以2K分辨率全高画质进行游戏体验，而在接下来几日则是用自己的电脑以1080P全低画质游玩。两厢对比之下，抛开画质上的“一在平地一在天”不谈，我并没有感到有明显的卡顿，也完全没有遇到任何闪退（全高有一次），除了第六章筋斗云很模糊外，总体来讲特别流畅，完美的保障了我们大量的低配玩家的游玩体验。 恶性Bug遇到两次，分别是一周目紫云山关卡毒敌大王“消失”，以及昨天晚上体验二周目时在第二章黄风岭被病虎扔到石头内，在返回标题页面后重新进入后就一切正常，总的来讲问题不是很大。再一个就是第五章火焰山关卡通关后，会发现狐妖萍萍的模型卡在BOSS战场景，但不能对话，且没有碰撞体积，不影响正常游玩。 游戏发售前，我曾对优化表达过担忧，毕竟在此之前几款虚幻5引擎制作的游戏，在优化上都有或多或少的问题，但游戏科学这次算是为虚幻5优化开了一个好头。 本作最大的优点，无疑就是美术方面，深山古寺、佛道雕塑、高山溪谷，无论人文还是自然景观，以及怪物的外形设计，都堪称完美恢弘。游戏本身也参考了类似《对马岛之魂》创作俳句的方式，鼓励玩家驻足欣赏。美术方面我不是很懂，所以也没什么好赘述的，仅从个人感受来讲，类似黄花观作为一座道观，出现不少佛像雕塑，可能略显违和，但考虑到多目怪在《西游记》原著中是被毗蓝婆菩萨收服（八戒拿钯就筑，又被毗蓝止住道：“天蓬息怒，大圣知我洞里无人，待我收他去看守门户也。”行者道：“感蒙大德，岂不奉承！但只是教他现本象，我们看看。”毗蓝道：“容易。”即上前用手一指，那道士扑的倒在尘埃，现了原身，乃是一条七尺长短的大蜈蚣精。毗蓝使小指头挑起，驾祥云径转千花洞去。），似乎出也不是不能理解。综上所述，美术满分。 关卡地图设计方面，网上对此似乎争论颇多，但我个人是大体满意的。诚然，有为了美术让步导致的指向不明以及空气墙问题，但由于我个人是个偏探索类玩家，享受的就是那种“山重水复疑无路，柳暗花明又一村”的感觉，可以说前四章完美契合在我的兴趣点上。 而且就二、三章来讲，也并不是完全的一本道地图，峰回路转，颇有“魂味儿”。类似独木桥弓箭手等，亦是在鼓励玩家多用法术手段应对，何况，这些弓箭手在杀死一次后并不会再次复活故意使玩家卡关，游科的怜悯了属于是——如果按照我的恶趣味，我是在会在玩家落入经幢内关卡后，直到打通BOSS魔将·妙音前，不许玩家传送出塔来增强代入感。 但第五章的地图就很不尽如人意了，完全是一条道走到黑的向上跑图，多是换皮怪，且黑秃秃一座山在美术场景上也说不上好看，显然是后期赶工的结果，毕竟牛魔王一家也不是什么煤炭成精，怎么会住在火焰山上，如果依照前三章的地图设计逻辑，我相信本章地图应该是包括火焰山、翠屏山、积雷山以及隐藏地图碧波谭的综合设计，并且以在火焰山顶大战本相牛魔王作结。 这方面由于明显的赶工造成的痕迹第四章也有体现——明明做了蜘蛛精六姊妹，却只有一场BOSS战，其余多数只在两次播片中出现，不知意义何在。当然，如果接连几次都是蜘蛛BOSS，难免让玩家审美疲劳，其实，完全可以只保留重要角色，而将精力放在其他关卡的设计上。综合来看游戏安排第三章小西天、第四章盘丝岭、第五章火焰山，而不是原著里火焰山——盘丝岭——小西天的顺序，显然也是出于藏拙的考虑，不过以及尽可能满足了玩家前中期的游戏体验，我认为是可以接受的。 虽然地图关卡设计我总体还是给好评的，但不得不承认，第六章的地图设计堪称灾难级别的表现，游戏给了玩家可以肆意翱翔的筋斗云，却是在一张空旷的大地图上随意安放几个BOSS，没有任何的视觉、小怪的引导，玩家能否找到几乎是在全凭运气了，并没有那种探索的反馈。也唯有这一章，逼得我不得不通过视频攻略找地图。怪哉，作为一只花果山出身的小猴子，西行一路上没觉得难走，唯有回家不认路了。 可以说本作的很多遗憾，都是由于赶工废案再利用导致的。 作为一款ARPG，动作系统无疑是重中之重，在这里先说结论：有特色，深度不足，但恰到好处。 本作的核心战斗思路，是轻攻击平A+完美闪避积攒棍式，再通过重攻击一次性释放来对敌人造成大量伤害。在这个基础上，给玩家提供了三段架势用来应对不同情况，配合参考原著的变身、精魄与各种法术，提供了极高的性能。乍一看，似乎类似光荣特库摩的《卧龙：苍天陨落》的加强与《仁王》系列的弱化。但应该说只是学习了其中优点，本质上还是大有不同的。比方说虽然同样三段架势，但本作的轻攻击动作模组其实是一样的，三段架势区别在于切手技与蓄力重攻击，这极大的简化了操作空间，方便了轻度玩家的上手，法术方面的思路与仁王的阴阳术、卧龙的奇术更是完全不同。尤其是精魄系统，武器系统，因为RPG养成要素的简化，比起仁王魂核的无限刷词条，真是领先五百年不为过。 但是正因为动作模组的缺少，在简化了操作难度同时，又会显得深度不足，如果长时间游玩，会极大破坏中后期游戏体感——这方面《卧龙》就是个很好的例子，卧龙在提供十多套武器模组的同时，中期开始的操作重复感（大概就是打完魔化吕布后）都非常明显——考虑到本作只有一种武器（算上枪的话两种），也是极容易产生疲惫感，好在本作体量不是很大，再加上法术系统的配合足够优秀，演出足够炸裂，在玩家还没有产生厌烦的同时游戏已经结束，所以说也可以说是恰到好处。顺便一提，《只狼》其实也是如此，他的以弹刀为核心的动作系统其实是很有趣但单调的，好在体量与难度原因，在玩家产生乏味的之前已经通关或退游了。 怪物设计上，总体BOSS都是很优秀的，类似幽魂、虎先锋、亢金星君、黄眉大王、毒敌大王、王灵官、二郎神、大圣残躯，都是给我印象深刻的角色。但中后期，某些BOSS给玩家上强度的方式总是靠丢锁定、强行换锁定、小场景龙车来实现，尽管难度说不上太高，却不可避免给玩家以厌恶感。这里重点批评亢金龙，一度让我觉得腐败树灵也不是不能接受。而像四大天王的法天相地战斗，有点游戏性让位于演出了，虽然确实演出爆炸，但全程只能按XY两个键位，不如加些QTE的好。 RPG方面已经说了对于仁王那种刷子游戏的词条简化，似乎在IGN日本是作为扣分项的，在我看来则是大大的加分项，方便了制作组设计难度同时，也让玩家不必在游戏中度过重复的垃圾时间（但其实我为了收集火铃草种子，几乎两个小时都在退出重开）。像魂系死亡惩罚，现在也变得越发没意义——谁会在乎那么点魂，到本作里直接取消，是很明智的选择。 最后，终于要落脚到剧情上了。这也将是我对本作批评最为严重的部分，七个字：吴闲云的尾气。 老实讲，我对ARPG的剧情优劣一向不怎么在乎，像仁王、战神、艾尔登法环等在我看来都是剧情比较一般甚至糟糕的（前面举的例子其中战神4相对最好，但5的收尾很差了）。所以游戏宣布初期时，我并不怎么在意，甚至《戒网》视频时就表达出隐隐担忧，但是随着宣发中所谓“尊重原著”、“改编不是乱编”、“过去斗战神幼稚，不会再搞阴谋论”、“改编自《西游记》”等言论，以及被视频中所表现出的“严肃感”给感染到，我开始有了对此的期待。但结果内容仍然是吴闲云那一套，甚至可以说算“宣发欺诈”了。 因为对吴闲云那一套太过熟悉，可以说一说猪八戒跟蜘蛛精有一腿，我就知道出处是吴闲云的蜘蛛精是七仙女下凡；一说红孩儿的身世，不用想都知道这里头有太上老君的事情；至于真结局倒放西游记，无非是呼应“《西游记》要倒着看才是真相”的老掉牙阴谋论，顺便配图里还在暗示“人参果肥料是小儿心”。至于游戏里说“泾河龙王为取经而冤死”的公案，更是想让人说求你了解下封建农业社会打龙王的习俗吧。 只能说空空和精精的爱情故事，你要是告诉我白骨精生前是“金鼎国公主”我也认了，好歹算个出处。猪八戒的爱情二创明明有高翠兰这个现成的角色，或者更了解点原著的还可以有个卵二姐/卯二姐，来往七绝山的蟒蛇精（八戒随后赶上来，又举钯乱筑。行者把那物穿了一个大洞，钻将出来道：“呆子！他死也死了，你还筑他怎的？”八戒道：“哥啊，你不知我老猪一生好打死蛇？”遂此收了兵器，抓着尾巴，倒拉将来。）或者说玉兔身上来靠的。（猪八戒所调戏的嫦娥——霓裳仙子在原著九十五回有出场：正此观看处，猪八戒动了欲心，忍不住跳在空中，把霓裳仙子抱住道：“姐姐，我与你是旧相识，我和你耍子儿去也。”行者上前揪着八戒，打了两掌骂道：“你这个村泼呆子！此是甚么去处，敢动淫心！”八戒道：“拉闲散闷耍子而已！”那太阴君令转仙幢，与众嫦娥收回玉兔，径上月宫而去。） 即使抛开这些无聊的阴谋论，单从《黑神话》框架内承认佛道之争，仙恶妖善，来看这个故事最大的问题他是在否定原著中孙悟空的形象：序章“经我取到了……”完全是在否定整个西游取经的正当性（“偷抢拐骗，杀人放火，毁山灭洞”这是人话？）。否定了孙悟空身上的佛性：  猴王又道：“我无性。人若骂我，我也不恼；若打我，我也不嗔，只是陪个礼儿就罢了。一生无性。”  天花乱坠，地涌金莲。妙演三乘教，精微万法全。慢摇麈尾喷珠玉，响振雷霆动九天。说一会道，讲一会禅，三家配合本如然。开明一字皈诚理，指引无生了性玄。 孙悟空在旁闻讲，喜得他抓耳挠腮，眉花眼笑。忍不住手之舞之，足之蹈之。忽被祖师看见，叫孙悟空道：“你在班中，怎么颠狂跃舞，不听我讲？”悟空道：“弟子诚心听讲，听到老师父妙音处，喜不自胜，故不觉作此踊跃之状。望师父恕罪！”（西游记第一二回）  可以说孙悟空自菩提祖师学艺之前、之时身上就有很高的禅心。取经途中，多次出现的情节是孙悟空给唐僧讲经、辩经： 唐僧道：“徒弟们仔细，前遇山高，恐有虎狼阻挡。” 行者道：“师父，出家人莫说在家话。你记得那乌巢和尚的《心经》云心无挂碍，无挂碍，方无恐怖，远离颠倒梦想之言？但只是扫除心上垢，洗净耳边尘。不受苦中苦，难为人上人。你莫生忧虑，但有老孙，就是塌下天来，可保无事。怕甚么虎狼！”长老勒回马道：“我当年奉旨出长安，只忆西来拜佛颜。舍利国中金象彩，浮屠塔里玉毫斑。寻穷天下无名水，历遍人间不到山。逐逐烟波重迭迭，几时能彀此身闲？”行者闻说，笑呵呵道：“师要身闲，有何难事？若功成之后，万缘都罢，诸法皆空。那时节，自然而然，却不是身闲也？”长老闻言，只得乐以忘忧。（西游记第三十二回）  行者笑道：“你这老师父，忒也多疑，做不得和尚。我们一同四众，偏你听见甚么水声。你把那《多心经》又忘了也？”唐僧道：“多心经乃浮屠山乌巢禅师口授，共五十四句，二百七十个字。我当时耳传，至今常念，你知我忘了那句儿？” 行者道：“老师父，你忘了‘无眼耳鼻舌身意’。我等出家人，眼不视色，耳不听声，鼻不嗅香，舌不尝味，身不知寒暑，意不存妄想，如此谓之祛褪六贼。你如今为求经，念念在意，怕妖魔不肯舍身，要斋吃动舌，喜香甜嗅鼻，闻声音惊耳，睹事物凝眸，招来这六贼纷纷，怎生得西天见佛？”三藏闻言，默然沉虑道：“徒弟啊，我一自当年别圣君，奔波昼夜甚殷勤。芒鞋踏破山头雾，竹笠冲开岭上云。夜静猿啼殊可叹，月明鸟噪不堪闻。何时满足三三行，得取如来妙法文？”行者听毕，忍不住鼓掌大笑道：“这师父原来只是思乡难息！若要那三三行满，有何难哉！常言道，功到自然成哩。”（西游记第四十三回）  行者笑道：“你把乌巢禅师的《多心经》早已忘了？”三藏道：“我记得。”行者道：“你虽记得，还有四句颂子，你却忘了哩。”三藏道：“那四句？”行者道：“佛在灵山莫远求，灵山只在汝心头。人人有个灵山塔，好向灵山塔下修。”三藏道：“徒弟，我岂不知？若依此四句，千经万典，也只是修心。”行者道：“不消说了，心净孤明独照，心存万境皆清。差错些儿成惰懈，千年万载不成功。但要一片志诚，雷音只在眼下。似你这般恐惧惊惶，神思不安，大道远矣，雷音亦远矣。且莫胡疑，随我去。”那长老闻言，心神顿爽，万虑皆休。（西游记第八十五回）  行者道：“师父，你好是又把乌巢禅师《心经》忘记了也？”三藏道：“《般若心经》是我随身衣钵。自那乌巢禅师教后，那一日不念，那一时得忘？颠倒也念得来，怎会忘得！”行者道：“师父只是念得，不曾求那师父解得。”三藏说：“猴头！怎又说我不曾解得！你解得么？”行者道：“我解得，我解得。”自此，三藏、行者再不作声。旁边笑倒一个八戒，喜坏一个沙僧，说道：“嘴脸！替我一般的做妖精出身，又不是那里禅和子，听过讲经，那里应佛僧，也曾见过说法？弄虚头，找架子，说甚么晓得，解得！怎么就不作声？听讲！请解！”沙僧说：“二哥，你也信他。大哥扯长话，哄师父走路。他晓得弄棒罢了，他那里晓得讲经！”三藏道：“悟能悟净，休要乱说，悟空解得是无言语文字，乃是真解。”（西游记第九十三回）  佛乃觉者，可以说孙悟空一路取经正是一路修心成正果的路程，他成为斗战胜佛不是因为佛祖亲封，而是因为他自己一路上以及修证成真——打破顽空须悟空。 游戏剧情在完全否认游戏内核的同时搞简单的仙妖对立（菩萨妖精，总是一念；若论本来，皆属无有），纯粹是西幻作品种族乱斗入脑的结果，至于反对长生不老，我甚至怀疑是不是受宫崎英高影响。 说到底，《黑神话：悟空》除了本身高质量水平外，西游这个IP也是很重要的，哪怕是游戏内，孙悟空为了所谓自由，分散六根，结果起码养出黄风怪、黄眉大王、多目怪法力大增去为祸一方，这个角色的魅力又在哪里呢？说白了，全网都希望序章反转，找那个不存在的第三结局，不就是因为对剧情不满意。 只能说游戏剧情的最大问题在于他们其实是熟悉原著的，但审美趣味却在吴闲云那里，最后的特别鸣谢里没有吴闲云属实算一种遗憾了。  综上所述，《黑神话：悟空》不仅仅是国内第一款3A，更是一款非常优秀的具有创新性的ARPG，无论是顶级的美术、演出、音乐，还是极具特色的动作战斗系统，地图与关卡设计也算可圈可点，尤其游戏最后看到制作组名单一串的中国人，真的很难不感动、激动，是我今年玩到的最好的游戏，期待DLC和续作，唯一的遗憾是他不是个合格的《西游记》改编故事。 美术：10/10 （30%） 关卡设计：8/10（20%）

0.8859406113624572,schinese,9.5更新，已全成就。 这一周过于忙碌，辗转贴吧b站知乎等地，嘴皮子都要磨破了。 休赛期休赛期休赛期休赛期休赛期休赛期休赛期，等taa颁奖再战。 暂时回六六村养老了。 让我想起了曾经在小村的日子。 1996————2024  9.2更新  反驳一些节奏点  1.游科说“要求所有设定都能在原著中找到根据，力求创造尽可能对位的西游世界观”，其实后面还有很长一段话，包括“设计风貌差异巨大的场景设计”，“还原妖怪洞府所在的位置”，“设计主人公的技能”，前文中的设定囊括了妖怪，场景，法宝，技能等，这些都能找到根据，不是完美还原原著？ 来扯的无非全都是拿剧情来说事，但是前面这段采访可没提到剧情也要还原。 有人肯定又要反问，设定不包括剧情？ 。。。。。。 。。。。。。 你都这样了，那我就顺从你好了  2.游科说“目前游戏故事情节与斗战神完全分离了”，还是一样，把后面的话也发出来。 冯骥说自己对西游的理解经历了三个阶段，一是看猴哥打妖怪神气热闹，二是读完了悟空传，觉得我命由我不由天，现在是第三阶段，跳出以主角为中心的视角，看到西游中形形色色的生命和自洽的活法，人人都有自己的生活背景。当年做斗战神时，他们给妖精做了一些背景故事的设定，但都过于单薄，这次希望做出值得尊重的反派。 斗战神就是第二阶段，而他们所说的与斗战神完全分离的故事情节其实就是形形色色的妖怪的小故事，也就是黑神话里的影神图，他们做到了吗？做到了吧。 （有弱智不知道吧在句末能表示肯定，补充一下）  当然，上述两条有人觉得我在洗，随便了，有分歧正常。  3.“原著党”称猴哥不能谈恋爱 元杂剧中猴哥抢来了金鼎公主做老婆 西游补中猴哥当年在嫂嫂肚里闹腾，最后搞了个儿子出来 南游记中猴哥有个女儿，女儿的法宝是骷髅头，母亲身份估计不一般吧 鬼鬼，古人创作的更劲爆诶，建议原著党把这些书一起冲了。 哦对了，当代动画影视剧啊几乎每个猴哥都有个cp吧 一起冲了得了  4.有人说猴哥杀妻证道 杀从何而来？ 原话提到死了？ 有人说都打碎了，能不死？ 可打碎的就一定是真身？ 至于跟白骨精谈合不合适，我不评价，我这条反驳的是“杀”。 它们会说我在抠字眼，诶，没错，我就扣了。 串子喜欢遣词造句带节奏，那我就来扣扣字眼，魔法对轰谁不会啊？ 轰完我估计谁也说服不了谁，那就回归最原始的侮辱性对骂好了，我觉得它们应该骂不过我。  5.有人说游戏抹黑猴哥 mgb影神图里夸猴哥这么多当看不见，是真的战略性眼瞎啊，就盯着步云鹿那一篇？ 它们会说这次可不是它们遣词造句，这都是步云鹿里的原话，有本事再扣扣字眼试试? 诶，我继续扣，我先把“霹雳手段”四个字扣下来塞它们左眼里，我再把“说”这个字扣下来糊它们右眼上。 这时候估摸着双方又是各执一词了，回归第四条，直接开骂吧。   6.有人说神佛皆黑 二郎神，梅山兄弟，六丁六甲，弥勒，龟蛇二将等人表示啊对对对对对对对对对对对对对   其他节奏点随缘再更新吧  最后来点奢望（完整的六丁六甲） 1.子鼠：仓库系统，这里的仓库不是单纯存放物品，而是在架子上摆放珍玩，或是在假人上放置整套装甲。 2.丑牛：建造系统，可扩容六六村（村子弄成开放世界，取消空气墙）并且建造房屋器具。 3.寅虎：铁匠系统，武器防具有耐久度，增加镶嵌系统，可将宝石附于装备。 4.卯兔：才艺系统，玩家可自行写诗作画，甚至可以自己diy装备或者葫芦。 5.辰龙：种植系统，新增作物合成。 6.巳蛇：幻境系统，蛇喜冬眠，进入幻境与过往交手的boss对打。 7.午马：随从系统，一是特殊随从，完成隐藏任务收取，为村子常驻npc。二是小妖随从，新增法宝捆仙索，可抓捕小妖，血量越低越容易抓捕。 8.未羊：异闻系统，一是珍宝（能放在架子上的）异闻，二是奇人异闻，可进入小副本收编剩余的六丁六甲与隐藏npc。 9.申猴：葫芦系统。 10.酉鸡：炼毒系统，可在大地图抓毒虫进行炼化。 11.戌狗：炼丹系统。 12.亥猪：厨艺系统，中华美食必须整上，食用食物可以获得长时间加成。  ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————  一周目双结局通关，本来想给9分的，但是最近突然冒出来一堆自号为“原著党”的臭鱼烂虾在那里上蹿下跳，那我不得不给这游戏10分了。 近年来“原著党”做了什么贡献捏？哦，带货卖书，刺激经济发展，鬼鬼，真是功德无量啊。 “原著党”看过几个版本的西游记呢？ “原著党”生平做的最大贡献是比拼战力吗？ “原著党”的影响力能超出贴吧和b站么？ 我也不拐弯抹角了 一骂弓手冬郎。 二骂看过书却给他人扣上破环传统文化帽子的“原著党”。 三骂对书一知半解，却伪装成“原著党”不断复制粘贴别人的话带节奏的串子。 四骂来跟我对线的云狗，你云，我无所谓。既云又来招惹我，我懒得跟你对线，我直接问候你家族谱。 别说我开地图炮哦，定语加的够多了哦。 说实话在这里比在贴吧喷人爽多了，一不用担心用词被和谐，二可以看到库存（隐藏库存我默认你是云哦） 当然，我也分辨的出来哪些是正常来讨论剧情的人，我非常欢迎。  目前剧情我的评价是平平无奇，留白太多，挖坑太多。某些up强行尬吹上升到那种程度说实话挺离谱的。 好消息是这游戏剧情几乎就是它的最短板了，dlc完全有机会把完整的故事呈现出来。  贴一段b站老哥的评论： 在谈文化保护之前，先得让文化活起来，否则很容易会遇到京剧界现在面临的问题，圈内孤芳自赏，圈外门可罗雀。已死甚至垂死的文化那可算不得文化，那不过是遗老遗少们手中的遗珠，任是如何的绝妙精巧也免不了带进坟里随葬的结局。 大众对于文化的理解往往不够深刻，因而会更加青睐流行化、娱乐化的作品。在这种情况下，“传统文化 这枚“炮仗”若想继续遍地开花，就难免要给自身裹一层流行化、娱乐化的“糖衣”。这“糖衣炮仗”可是吃下去了才会见效，现在这“糖衣”还没下了肚，就急着以“破坏文化”之名批判其“炮仗”的本质，未免有些过于“居高临下”了。 所谓“考据家”、 原著党”这种名头最忌拿来压人。“考据家”本质不过是拾人牙慧，牵强附会而已; 原著党”更是可悲，“解读原著”的行为本身就是一种解构，所谓“解读”终究不过一己之见，和所谓“魔改”“戏说”之流本是一丘之貉却还自诩高人一等，更是落了下乘。 所谓文化，其质如水，因人而异，因地制宜，因时而动。文学批评还是要实事求是一些，打着“文化保护”的旗号，以“还原原著”之名行“党同伐异”之实，未免有些太难看了。  最后是我自己的一些感想： 大概一年前在贴吧看到个帖子，谈及最为钟情的作品，众座者通篇累牍皆为国外神作。 多少挺感慨吧。不少国外作品我也很喜欢，不过在我眼里，九十年代左右的一些国产单机游戏，现在仍是那些国外作品难以逾越的高峰。 诸如河洛三部曲，国产三剑，流星蝴蝶剑，绝代双骄，幻世录，天龙八部，天河传说，刀剑封魔录，幽城幻剑录等。 当真是百花齐放。 然而，二十年多前的昙花一现，竟成了绝响。 毕竟现在手游多赚钱呐。反观单机游戏工作室，缺人缺钱缺技术，举步维艰。 我一直在等。等国单步月登云，遐迩着闻的那一天。 14年，河洛工作室重组，我与国单的初心重逢。 四年后，以开放世界为噱头的河洛群侠传首发暴死，我为国单的野心与短阙而哀叹。 同年，中国式家长等小品级游戏上线，我品鉴了国单的机趣。 随着太吾绘卷，修仙模拟器，鬼谷八荒三大幻神相继登场，国单之魂再度闪耀。 在我心中，武侠，仙侠，历史，神话，民俗，国学，音吕是为国单七魂。 可惜，可惜。 茄子一意孤行，太吾褒贬不一。 吉艾斯球手游背刺，修仙2遥遥无期。 张三姿态傲慢，三国杀鬼谷齐头并进。 我见到了国单的迷惘与徘徊。 直到20年8月20日。 诚然，这些年也不乏优秀作品。 烟火刻苦铭心，觅长生返璞归真，逸剑王道江湖，山河旅探动情演绎，火山女儿乖巧可人，全网公敌通幽洞微。。。。。。 但远远不够。 侠隐阁虎头蛇尾，汉家松鼠直接开摆，江湖十一大言不惭，活侠传两极分化，燕云十六可笑之至，类完蛋跟风丑态。。。。。。 此长彼消，国单的发展依旧停滞无前。  该说到黑猴了。 本人并非动作游戏爱好者，比起西游也更热衷三国，所以初见pv，仅是惊叹，更多的是狐疑猜隙。 那时的我觉得它高高在上，是如此遥不可及。只怕其终为神话，可见不可得，咫尺隔天涯。 21年，心中逐渐燃起希望之火。 22年，思潮起伏，身为国单遗老，自小到大，都对国单兼怀信任与包容。树大招风，纵使质责之声屡见不鲜，吾亦当坚信不疑。 23年，彻底疯魔，它的一切令我如痴如狂。 24年，如今心如止水，只待尘埃落定。一如标题的悟空，静悟灵空。  故事改编自九典故籍，建筑雕塑扫描自寺壁庙廷，辞致清辩，笙磬同音，可谓国之艺术，世之珍瑰。 但还是有人妄自尊大，目空一切，觉得游戏是荼毒生民的始作俑者。 进度年年更递，试玩会场无虚席，‌不驰于空想，不骛于虚声，可谓足履实地，笃行不倦。 但还是有人认为它是空中阁楼，如海市蜃阙无影无形。 主创不矜不伐，戒骄戒躁，敦兮若朴，旷兮若谷，可谓被褐怀宝，气志渊虚。 但还是有人罗钳吉网，营蝇斐锦，端的有来俊之风，孟青之威。 团队倾抱写诚，赤忱恂达，如月之恒， 如日之升。可谓抟心揖志，鸿业远图。 但还是有人诋讪遍野，萋詈成市，恰好似燕雀之讥，惠蛄之见。 惊，疑，信，喜，急。 讽，哂，忌，怒，诟。 贴吧黑子白子串子乐子各执一词，赛博战争无止无休。  这些年一路走来，我也见到了无数心怀理想的玩家。 他们热泪盈眶，百感交集。 我同他们一样。 天时地利人和，黑猴已是国单的领头羊与强心剂。 这一刻等了许久。 我终见到国产单机游戏的曙光。,3982.0,2024-08-28 17:47:12,Recommended

0.8608151674270629,schinese,最近这两天黑神话悟空的口碑在贴吧和b站已经“褒贬不一”了，贴吧b站一堆云玩家最近狂喷这款游戏的剧情，这说明他们实在是找不到什么能黑的地方了，而剧情又是最影响他们云游戏体验的地方，所以他们给这款游戏判了死刑。 在我看来，游戏剧情确实虎头蛇尾，有瑕疵，但整体上看这依然是一款佳作，268的售价绝对物超所值。不存在完美的游戏，这两年的大满贯游戏老头环和博德之门3都存在后期赶工的问题。但是，这些游戏之所以能成为游戏史上的里程碑，不在于它们有多么完美，而在于它们足够特别，它们的长板足够长，能让玩家忍受游戏的缺点后依然不吝赞美。黑神话悟空也是如此，作为游戏科学的第一款高规格游戏，它确实有很多问题，但它的长板足够长，优点足够强势，顶级的美术和画面，顶级的音乐，游戏中的变身系统更是天才般的设计，支撑起略显单薄的战斗体验。这些优点就注定它是一款佳作。 无脑黑的人再怎么否定这款游戏，也改变不了事实——4天卖出1000万份的商业成绩和Steam好评如潮的玩家口碑（至少目前还是好评如潮）。毕竟，我们玩家只用好好体验游戏就行了，而云玩家要考虑的就多了。“踏上取经路，比抵达灵山更重要。”,486.0,2024-08-28 17:09:04,Recommended

0.7491992115974426,schinese,[h1] 前言[/h1]  历经80个小时候终于达成全成就才来写评测。很感动，很欣慰，游戏科学就像是村里第一个考上大学的学生，本以为最多是个本科，没想到考上的是世界名校。无论我们未来会对这第一部国产3A游戏如何评价，游戏科学已然创造了奇迹，《黑神话：悟空》在中国甚至世界游戏史上都留下了浓墨重彩的一笔。    [h1] 评分：9.5（实体评分9+0.5情怀分）必玩佳作[/h1]  [h1] 优点：[/h1]  1、游科堆料。游戏内容太丰富了，一周目不看攻略60小时左右的探索依然还有漏掉的地方。不同于其他3A游戏大量重复的收集或支线，《黑神话：悟空》这样以疯狂堆叠新元素、新BOSS游戏体量的做法我真没在其他3A游戏上见过。在对战充满挑战的BOSS后玩家又会被虚幻五打造的绝美风景所震撼。这游戏价格如果是欧美厂商至少398起步，日本厂商至少598起步，国内卖298说实话我觉得已经算低了。  2、战斗系统。没想到游科第一次做游戏，战斗系统的设计能达到这个地步，已经远超我的预想了。棍式、法宝、元神、变身、法术。几个系统配合起来相得益彰，很好的融合在了一起。实际使用起来的演出效果也是完全能达到神仙斗法的地步。  3、虽然整个流程下来剧情的视野并没有像我预想中的那样聚焦于整个西游世界的异变，但游科依然很好的将每回章节所要探讨的精神内核都融入到了游戏基础设计中，特别是每一章节最后的动画，真的太绝了。每次通关一个章节都有种当年第一次看《爱死机》期待感。  4、文化输出。无论是真实还原的中国古文物建筑还是陕北说书唱腔，还是影神图的怪物图鉴诗词都是只有中国上千年未曾中断的文化底蕴才能做出来的东西，这是全世界独一份的。这才是文化自信。更别提还有每一个中国人耳熟能详的西游故事。  5、音乐，大量中国乐器，古筝、唢呐、三弦。大多数BOSS战都配有专属的BGM，特别是打亢金龙和最终决战的时候，听的人起鸡皮疙瘩。  6、细节，大到人物对话台词、boss对战的隐藏彩蛋、小到UI设计，游科都是做了大量的适配的。比如影神图目录退出后会保存到你阅读的地方（我手柄老是按错退出），游科是真的会玩自己的游戏的。[spoiler]（欧美游戏厂商有多狗屎和傲慢就不用我说了吧？点名批评暴雪和绝地潜兵2） [/spoiler]  [h1] 缺点：[/h1]  1、优化。专门为这游戏从6750换到7800X。虽然大部分时候游戏表现良好，但依然存在每次新进游戏的时候严重卡顿。跑动卡一两秒、进菜单卡一两秒、传送卡半天。好在运行个10多分钟这问题就不存在了。这妥妥的优化问题。  2、空气墙，本质上来说这应该算游科经验不足和画面表现取舍的问题。另一方面是地图设计不友好，虽然我觉得没《空洞骑士》《黑暗之魂》这些难记就是了。但要说的一点是在花果山这一张地图中这个缺点被无限放大，甚至可以称的上恶心。  3、部分BOSS战，个别大型BOSS战的设计堪称灾难，毫无交互体验不说，还很容易让人破防，一方面是你打你的我打我的（大石敢当）。另一方面是攻击模型判定丢失（百眼魔君），都在不断给本该热血沸腾的战斗演出泼冷水。虽然游科敢挑战大型BOSS战设计勇气可嘉，但没做好依然要批评。  4、依然是剧情。并不是说不好，毕竟每次对传统文化的再译，都是为其注入新的生命活力。[spoiler]但游科应该说明该剧本改编自《斗战神》与《悟空传》，而不是原著《西游记》。虽然我也很喜欢今何在的《悟空传》，那句“怎能忘了西游。”我一直记忆犹新。但很多不了解《斗战神》和《悟空传》的玩家心理对照着86版西游记来带入，难免会有些蒙蔽。（六老师，孙悟空到底有几个女朋友啊）而且挖坑容易填坑难啊，游戏到最后不但没填完，反而越挖越多。 [/spoiler]    [h1] 最后给玩家的建议：[/h1]  我很少预购游戏，更很少原价买游戏，因为大多数所谓的3A大作不值原价，但268买《黑神话：悟空》我觉得，值。    [h1] 最后给游科的建议：[/h1]  建议游科研究下两个游戏，一个是《火影忍者究极风暴系列》，一个是《古墓丽影：暗影》。前者可以参考过场动画QTE演出，玩的时候我就在想，如果能放在亢金龙撞金铙、战大石敢当、战四大天王时会有多震撼，绝对比单纯的播片强上数倍。  后者可以参考关卡设计（古墓），顺便我觉得游科如果下一部做《鬼吹灯》绝对无敌，哪怕是照搬《古墓丽影：暗影》的系统不改一点，虚幻五的画面、优秀的剧情、中国古文化不比什么玛雅吸引人多了？顺便还可以练练关卡设计。    最后感谢各位一路看到这里。  ~欢迎查看更多多彩游戏人生精彩评测(～￣▽￣)～、  https://steamcommunity.com/groups/smallseals  ,1955.0,2024-08-29 17:12:40,Recommended

0.646328866481781,schinese,[h1]老规矩开篇叠甲。预售购入豪华版，自20号至今玩了50小时，作为中国首款质量过硬的诚意之作，各种美誉已不需再说，我个人对游戏持绝对推荐态度。只要你不是毫无单机经验的小白，我都建议至少购入标准版体验游戏。差评百分之八十原因为了让制作方看到游戏诸多问题，剩下的二十是因为严重低于个人预期，是绝对主观的个人原因。如果您看到这里就已经红温，触发暴跳如雷。那我觉得您大可不必再往下看，一个好的作品，特别是这种体量的作品，有争议是必然。我作为从第一支预告片关注到预售，然后第一时间购入豪华版并用心体验了50小时如果还不能自由的发表一些自己的看法，那我只能说咱们的游戏环境实在是太糟糕了。 如果您愿意从别人的视角了解游戏，感谢您的观看，本篇目前测评不是完整版，想到哪说到哪。我目前只推到了第四章的一半，后续可能还有补充 [/h1]  作为老国单玩家一路从三剑，古剑，荡神志，刀剑封魔录这些过来有个毛病：喜欢舔图。一是  那时候不怎么会找攻略，游戏资源总是很匮乏，经常短缺，前中期一颗止血草我都不想放过。  二是那时制作经费和能力受限，游戏内容体量太小，支线和隐藏内容非常珍贵和惊喜。甚至是  NPC一句话我都不想错过。这就有了第一个我非常难受甚至无法接受的点：这游戏想完整舔图  极其困难。我前四章50小时起码有一半的时间在摸图记路。BOSS也就寅虎打了仨小时（半小  时初过，两个半小时练闪避识破）其他的基本没卡，也没迷路。就是记路特别麻烦，而且这个  麻烦是人为故意造成的。你没有地图我可以理解，箱庭探索需要沉浸感，弱引导甚至无引导都  行，但你不能误导。这种感觉1-3章逐步递增。其实黑风山打完我是很惊喜的，游戏画面不必再  夸，毫无疑问世界级。战斗视角问题也还没有暴露出来，第一章很轻松的就走遍了地图每一个  角落，而且确定一棵草都没落下。到了黄风岭就开始难受了，明明知道是线性游戏不是开放世  界，但地图设计给我的感觉就是目之所及哪都能到。空气墙后边有山洞有拐角，甚至有一条路  一扇门。玩着玩着我总有种感觉是不是这附近有隐藏的交互我没看到？加上过亮的地图风格  （其实是加分项，挺完美的展示了八百里黄风岭风貌）和粪怪偷袭，舔图记路的时候开始有些  烦躁。而且第二章开始暴露出了几乎所有人都会提到的视角问题，我印象很深的是一个门前有  三个老鼠刺客，忘了叫什么了。进去之后三个活畜生就开始排队突刺，两边地形也不是很宽阔  我只能退出来伺机而动。退出来之后旁边有个大裂缝，你只要翻滚下去那算完了，视角马上卡  死在那个裂缝高低差边缘，这时候你看这仨BYD扎不扎你就完了。给我扎的取消锁定都跳不上  来。这里跟打寅虎差不多，卡了我差不多有半小时。正常推到这技术也不成熟，又一直卡视  角。就突然特别烦，之前为了想跑支线记的路也忘了，总之就是特别破坏游戏体验。这种糟糕  的感觉延续到了小西天，第三章地图设计纯灾难级表现。特别是滑雪下来之后，茂密的植被，  迷眼的雪景，扯淡的上下多层设计几乎没法记路。从低处到高处既能跟着走台阶上去，也能莫  名其妙打着打着走雪坡上去。到处都是雪和树，感觉这地儿来过，又感觉没来过。感觉是跟前  两章一样，能到的地方都到了，但至今我也不知道第三章东西拿没拿完。战斗体验第三章也是  到了最差，大模型怪越来越多，视角锁定丢失的更快，锁定的位置更狗屎。亢金龙飞起来劈  你，甚至看不到地上的预警。而且粪怪也增加了，被群殴的次数也增加了。怪一扎堆锁定视角  就乱转，也没啥顶用的AOE技能，然后被打死。黑风山我在非战斗状态经常停下来转动视角欣  赏风景，黄风岭就打完BOSS会停下来看看，到了小西天，一直被错乱的空间感围绕+被各种粪  怪偷袭以至于我根本无暇顾及游戏美学，只有无尽的烦躁和对跑图的厌烦。这种极差的游戏体  验等到小雷音寺的时候到达了顶峰！在经历了极乐谷精神错乱般的地图设计之后，迎来的是一  个极其庞大的区域小雷音寺。好消息是这里没有树啊雪啊那么多干扰项，路很好找。坏消息是  除了路好找之外偌大的地形几乎什么也没有，连土地庙也几乎没有。极乐谷一个小地方塞四个  庙，这么大个寺就给俩。一个在门口，一个在BOSS房。要是不小心死了就得以不快的移速再  跑好久。终于被海上僧打死两次之后我心态终于崩了。直接关闭了游戏两天没玩。   第二个就是老生常谈的游戏视角问题，这个纯战犯级设计。只要是打大型怪，没有不难受的。  一锁就水平固定，也不拉远，位置也特别奇怪。打吧，不好打到。闪吧，不好闪开。搞得我以  前从不练弹反的人开始找虎铁匠练了俩多钟头。而且我个人十分讨厌粪怪的设计。在缺乏远程  攻击手段和范围伤害手段的情况下，竟然多次出现两只小怪，三只小怪，精英加小怪，精英加  精英怪，BOSS加小怪，小怪加粪怪，精英加粪怪这种让人无语的组合。你也没给啥处理手段  啊？而且你不知道你战斗视角有多灾难吗？你整这干啥呀？打小雷音寺那个四腿金刚的时候，  死了好几次都是被雷劈死的，我观察了好久连它起手放电动作都没看出来，我还以为出BUG  了，又雷又火的。硬顶着雷给他打死了。结果都打死了我发现还一直被电，跑了一圈才发现八  百里开外有俩杨永信在楼上输出我。你干脆让第二章黄风岭的楼顶的老鼠跑第三章射我吧行  不？打个虎伥能给我劈到桥下，这时候空气墙呢？明明能打的有来有回的战斗，最起码有百十  次是因为视角问题打不到躲不开。战斗一到大模型建筑就拉近卡住，一到狭窄空间就天旋地  转，一到大模型BOSS就抬头仰视。游戏难度完全被游戏机制强行抬高。   第三个是引导性的问题。黑猴的隐藏内容占比很大，但支线的引导可以说几乎为零。对于补全  游戏世界观那么重要，甚至影响最终结局的重要支线剧情，你可能漏听一段话就全完了，更多  的时候听了也没啥用。玩游戏我喜欢一周目开荒，尽可能找出全部隐藏，二周目再看一下攻略  查缺补漏（别问为什么说话前后矛盾，热度太大了从没主动搜过但被漏麻了）。但我目前为止  遇到的唯一有一丁点指引性的是只有白衣秀士问三口钟你可都见过了？像第二章飞龙鳞片，老  爷子就一句在黄风岭中，不是视频刷到位置我十周目估计都打不了四龙。这么重要的道具，你  告诉我在黄风岭，你干脆说在黑神话悟空这游戏中得了。更别说疯虎那种恶心人的触发条件  了。还有瓜田，正常推到这时候都是带更好用的定身法，这狗日的都冻成那个B样了也不舍得  说句：好汉可有火源能让我取暖？反正给我的感觉就是恶心，没有任何过度，藏的毫无意义。  不查几乎永远都找不到，查了就全漏了没有任何惊喜。不说让你UI里带，哪怕你关于飞龙鳞片  这种重要道具的线索带一句：黄风岭壁画之中大有玄机。我一面墙一面墙的找我也认了。线性  流程藏成这样，我认为已经破坏了正常的游戏体验。只有隐晦才能讲出好故事吗？举例古剑  三，支线大多都给的是直引导，但一点不妨碍游戏剧情的宏大叙事和丰富角色的人设补充。退  一万步讲，你风险和收益这么大的分支项，哪怕给些存档位呢？结果错过了只能二周目，再忍  受一遍各种逆天的战斗视角和地图设计。   说的真不少了，全都是槽点，有些客观大多主观，绝大多数都是从自身出发切身感受到的。说  的不对的地方欢迎各位批评指正。  还是那句话：整体上我真的喜欢并且十分推荐这款游戏，不是怕被暴，而是发自内心的为国单  迈出的这一大步感到高兴。我们也能有这种体量这种质量的好作品向外输出中式文化了。当过  刺客，当过猎魔人，当过牛仔，终于童年的梦也实现了当了一次齐天小圣，哈哈。图形技术，  游戏音乐，艺术性，创新玩法这些优点我就不过多赘述了，破圈的热度，牛逼的销量还有这如  潮的好评已经证明了太多的东西。影神图里连每个小怪我都细细看过，故事都很精彩，对于我  丰富游戏世界观有极大的帮助。这个是我个人最喜欢的一点。后续我也会继续通关然后开启二  周目，但时候如果有新的体会再和大家交流。    抱拳。     评论区低能儿是真多，有的甚至第一段加粗都没看完就开始喷粪，佛了。。。我大概看了一下，无脑喷粪的基本上都是属于那种短视频给脑子刷坏了的，扭大屁股能一看看半晌，长文看不了一点，看见差评俩字就直接应激了。  只回应一个问题：为什么魂类有同样的问题我不骂：因为我不玩魂类，也没买过。我登录界面都不知道啥样我评价人家干基霸啥？我只对自己购买并且体验过的内容给出评价。  君子和而不同，小人同而不和。莫说我对游戏总体质量持肯定且推荐态度了，我就算是完全的差评，喷它个狗血淋头，那也是我花了时间花了钱之后应有的权利。就像去一个饭店吃饭，我夸他菜又实惠又好吃的同时并不妨碍我说他厕所对着大厅就餐环境太糟糕。,3560.0,2024-08-31 18:08:00,Not Recommended
0.6351852416992188,schinese,"先亮游戏深度，1周目玩了65小时，影神图攒齐了，除了需要刷的和特殊方法获得的（下毒手）其他全获得。目前3周目，全成就，花了很久的时间挨个看影神图。你问为什么看影神图？因为我真的想找个第三结局，我怕真实的故事藏在影神图里。这游戏剪去后两章剧情多好啊，第二章打完，我还和朋友吹这游戏呢，吹的他们都买了。我1周目打完，他们才刚到第二章。看他们兴致勃勃，我已经不敢说话了。抛开剧情章节体验排行2>6>1>3>5>4。剧情章节体验排行2>1>3>4>>5>6。 有点bug有点优化问题，我理解。虚幻5的难度放在那，还是第一款单机，谁拿这个喷我和谁急；地图引导弱我也能接受，为美术让步嘛，而且我王城下水道都不怎么迷路的；地图薛定谔的空气墙也是为美术让步，我就喜欢全收集，本来也要多走两步，忍忍就过去了；大型怪物碰撞箱设计问题导致攻击不到，我有点难受，但也可以理解为处女作经验不足，而且又不是过不去对吧；[b] 索敌视野做的太烂，镜头调度太烂，导致怪物飞出屏外，让我有些破防，点名杨戬，普攻四段，第四段是投技。我贴身翻滚躲避，人家第三段没看清就飞出屏外了，第四段都不知哪出一枪给我抓住了，这样被抓了好多好多次，导致我后来不敢绕身躲，只能往后躲。一些会飞的怪物空中停滞也看不到，脖子得了颈椎病一样。而且三阶段杨戬投枪冲刺后，变招两种，一种回头冲下来加扫半圈狗咬一口，一种直接开眼电你。你那个镜头慢悠悠的跟过去，冲下来那招还好，前摇长。如果是开眼，等镜头刚看到杨戬就射你了，根本反应不过来，必被打。更不要说，大型boss的奇奇怪怪的镜头调度，俩人谁也没跳没飞，镜头自己甩上了。 [/b]我玩过的游戏也不多，对比鬼泣只狼法环，他们的敌人几乎一直都在屏幕中轴线附近，占全屏百分之50左右的区域。也就飞天，高看低，才会达到屏幕上下的边缘。他们的冲锋也是不到0.5秒就索敌镜头调度完成。黑神话这种就是观众看着很有张力，但是玩家玩着这点是真难受。 [h3]即使有点破防，以上问题加一起，我也能给你打个9分，情怀加分的话，我都能打10分[/h3] 别人说我不客观，我都可以说老子乐意支持猴哥。[b]但是你那个宣传和剧情是怎么个事？[/b]你要是参考悟空传，你就大大方方的说世界观是悟空传。我看不懂的地方大不了我就去找悟空传看。你还“改编自公元1592年中国神魔小说《西游记》”，我照着西游记看你留白的部分，我能看懂个啥？而且问题是你这剧情是真自创的改编么？你最爱的今何在老师他不会心痛么？制作斗战神知道请人来当指导，这次不想花钱是么？他本人来，我相信这剧情都不会像这样。 你这剧情真自以为写的好么？你讲明白什么东西了？为什么都在找第三结局，不就是因为对你这剧情不满意么？这剧情一言蔽之，孙悟空自杀脱下金箍。你自己觉得这故事讲完了么？你自己觉得这故事讲明白了么？你自己觉得这故事是个好故事么？ [h3]故事没讲完[/h3] 一个个都说等dlc，我nm单机看个结局还需要额外花钱是么？好！我花钱看，你半年内能做出来dlc么？dlc一般都扩展支线吧，不讲主线，那你下一作，一年能拿出来么？不能那你为什么要这么写？就喜欢玩家抓耳挠腮？打完杨戬，说你的路刚刚开始，怎么的，花这么多年做了个序章？ [h3]故事讲不明白[/h3] 观音指挥黑熊精干坏事图什么？太上老君搞一出借腹生子，然后夜叉就这么死了，不管了？孙悟空自行兵解了，就图个脱金箍，然后没了？天上的事，你主线没机会说，你影神图还藏着掖着？大部分小妖写的都是类似聊斋，头目妖王人物会涉及一些世界观，但加一起也没解释明白天庭灵山斗什么图什么，这方面我看1592年西游记能看出来么？剧情只能看出来，满天坏蛋，观音坏，灵吉坏，太上老君坏，天庭灵山坏，妖怪都是吃人的，自诩吃人是天性也都不是啥好玩意，孙悟空自杀脱下金箍，帮主角这边的，猪八戒，弥勒，66村，二郎神，菩提祖师。猪八戒和猴哥关系好，听老猴子的试试复活猴哥。弥勒看不出到底想干嘛。菩提祖师帮自己徒弟一把。66村和梅山怪都是二郎神安排的。[spoiler]听二郎神意思，这是二郎神和孙悟空合伙演的戏。那序章那句“你他娘的杀我猴子猴孙”颇有一种“为什么那一天妈妈会被巨人吃掉呢”的荒诞感。[/spoiler] [h3]人物塑造糟糕[/h3] 主要角色其实就猪八戒，二郎神，孙悟空。神佛妖怪人设崩一点也没所谓的。但你也就二郎神戏份少人物刻画浅，塑造的还行，其他两人都有问题。 整个第四章讲的就是猪八戒的情债，猪八戒强搞了个痴情人设，却又没给塑造。第四章的结尾动画你是不是还觉得怪感人呢？猪八戒追嫦娥追高翠兰追蜘蛛精，这特么见色起意哪点好了？俩人一顿闪图，不知道的还以为你俩经历了多么可歌可颂的生离死别呢，实际呢？取经路上破戒给人家留了种，杀了人家姊妹六个只放走了紫蛛儿，孩子还不敢认。听紫蛛儿意思你从没回去过。这叫什么感情戏？[spoiler]咱就把天庭再说的小气一点，天庭不图任何东西，专门恶心你这取经人，要用你的骨肉拿捏你，你怕孩子被你所害，不敢相认。那有没有可能，连洞中的猪妖都知道她的身世？即使全世界只有这猪妖知道，这段感情也依然逃脱不了一夜情定终身的荒诞。可真是“初夏的雨点，落得太敷衍”。[/spoiler] 孙悟空，设计的太空了，开篇就死了，只能通过章节动画和影神图了解。那么，看看你塑造了个怎样的大圣。主线是孙悟空杨戬设计摘下金箍。摘下金箍为了什么呢？没说明白。单看这一行径就是为了自己的自由，格局太小了吧？你大闹天宫，西天取经，你看遍人间，然后现在整这么大动静说只为了个人自由 ？有人说是为了天下百姓，那你影神图里就只说了一句我们吃百姓少吃就没了？百姓到底受什么苦了？你摘金箍是为了给老百姓种地么？摘了箍是你的终极目的么，应该不是吧，[spoiler]那tmd为！什！么！不！提！一！嘴！劳资等你金箍棒指天，“俺老孙又回来了”“诸天神佛不仁不义，我便反了这天”。我磕头求你了，你说一句行么？你这比寸止都过份，相当于马上快到了一刀阉了。[/spoiler]我tm想看的是猴哥，我一个哑巴天命人有鸡毛用啊，唐僧听我的么？八戒不还是叫我侄子？找谁不都是看大圣生前的脸面？我能带领花果山啊？杨戬能和我讨论计谋啊？再说第五章动画，你孙悟空和当年与你一起打上天庭的兄弟就这么说话啊？火焰山都第40多难了，你就跟个地痞流氓似的？有人说这是做戏给天庭看，告诉老牛别反抗。所以一定要用地痞流氓的方式演戏么，我不懂怎么想的。你做戏不站直了大声说？你离那么近“宝扇我也要定了”？再说了，你就和牛魔王普通聊聊天能怎么的？天兵能因为这个干老牛？你和他打一架就不干老牛了？[spoiler]老牛心里苦啊，之前你说打上天庭，好好好一起上了，现在又说找个师父修正果。还搅合的一家不得安宁，弟弟揍了，儿子送了，宝扇要抢，连小妾都打死了。气急暴起，还被砍头了。后面听你的，跟了个佛教师父，师父派我来打你。你还给我来一句站队一直站不对。那行，再听你的，你的东西，我只收着。然后呢？儿子为了这东西差点把老牛打死，最后儿子还被猴打死了。都说是天庭干的，可你所言老牛次次听啊。[/spoiler]最后就是争议最大的三次打碎过去的爱人白骨精，怎么的这恋爱就非谈不可么？好！谈就谈了，怎么还三次打碎啊。好！打就打了，成佛了怎么还念念不忘啊。好！念就念了，那你就回花果山猫着了？我真看不懂你加这段到底什么意义。没去取经之前，谈就谈了，勉强接受。那你这杀妻证道可真太恶心了。我琢磨那白骨精定然还是想吃唐僧，孙悟空才全然不念旧情。从此六根清净一心向佛。结果你还说他放不下，那显得前面的杀妻证道更恶心了！这下纯小人了，这都不是取经修心了，纯用一路妖怪换取果位。第六章真结局动画整个白骨精出来，还怕我忘了，我真tm谢谢你啊。这么一想，你这动画私货真tm多啊。 我本是想如法环那般观望一个月的，19号新华社采访，官方站台，立马预购了。再看到有些视频评论区高赞： 虽然我传过火,虽然我好打铁,虽然我当过艾尔登之王,虽然我可以驰骋在美国西部,虽然我单枪匹马杀穿浣熊镇,但是,但是我还是想做一次齐天大圣!  一从大地起风雷，便有精生白骨堆。 僧是愚氓犹可训，妖为鬼蜮必成灾。 金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。 今日欢呼孙大圣，只缘妖雾又重来。 当时甚是欢喜，如今看来，顿觉讽刺。当时想的是，文宣做出去了，中国玩家都玩的懂，去外网给他们普及补充妖怪故事，多好啊。现在想的是，可千万别把黑神话就当作西游记了，我们喜爱的孙大圣不是这样的。讲好中国故事，讲好中国故事，讲好中国故事。我真的以为很简单，是个中国人做的就一定能传达出中国的价值观，是我唐突了。第一次参与评价，看了三天影神图，扣字扣了两天。暂且言尽于此，心累。",3563.0,2024-08-30 09:49:56,Not Recommended
0.6320725083351135,schinese,"44小时通关，目前做全收集查漏补缺 先说结论，我的测评批评较多，MC综评81没问题，10分制我打8分。 本身作为国内第一款真正的3A单机大作，再加上西游记题材，虚幻5制作，热度直接爆炸，最重大的意义在于打破了中国20多年没有单机3A大作的窘境，就跟国足能进世界杯一样可喜可贺.通关后我有考虑一个问题，本作的优点是否能盖住缺点，我觉得没有，起码有一些缺点我觉得是要指出来批评的，对于国产来说MC81分已经开了一个好头，国内有情怀加分的话80-90分没问题，90分以上还不够。 加分项 +画质顶尖水准，国际3A大作水平 +音乐音效，不想列这一项，但是我听到了熟悉的BGM。 +顶级的美术风格，很多场景都很漂亮，题材特殊，在游戏市场基本是独树一帜 +探索奖励丰富，值得玩家地毯式搜索 +每一章结束后的动画制作精良，一些支线故事有趣  以下4个不是绝对的减分项，但也不是加分项，我比较直，只论一个普通玩家体验到的。 -地图设计 -战斗系统 -BOSS战设计 -剧情 1.地图设计：我想问问游科哪来的底气不做地图？这几年魂like兴起你也跟风是吧，而且在说了不是魂like的情况下，凭什么不做？你地图设计是跟黑魂一桌的吗？是牛魔，是跟仁王一桌的。大地图或者小地图但凡做了一个，网上那些喷地图烂的能改嘴一半，这是提前能预知的小问题。第3章第6章这种构思地图哪来的勇气不做小地图的？浮屠界诠释了该有空气墙的地方没有，不该有的都给你安排，还有那个掉上限的怪，我回到了伊鲁席尔监狱？游科你怎么在玩别人玩剩下的构思设计啊？前面说了游戏探索奖励丰富，但是大量的空气墙，无意义的岔路很影响玩家体验，不是绕回来就是其他路的终点。第6章的地图真是集百家之粪，丢给你一章大地图BOSS布置随意，这种设计水平你是刚打完帕鲁然后灵光一现吗？与前几章对比产生极强的割裂感，毫无探索欲望。 各章节地图设计水平参差不齐，第一章能给10分的情况下，第五章6分，第六章0分滚粗 空气墙的问题在于规律混乱，第二章打虎伥的时候会被他推下去，没有空气墙，但是打完后空气墙又产生了，求求统一设置好吧，这还只是其中一个缩影。  2.战斗系统： +先夸一下棍的动作模组，舞棍流畅有力，重棍蓄力每次打到敌人身上都极具力量感。而法术，变身，精魄还原了吗喽的神通又增加了游戏乐趣，很精妙的设计。 +可以随便洗点，让玩家更方便寻找合适的流派应对不同BOSS。  -预输入做得很差，或者根本没有，体现在喝药老是没喝成，到了后期我都需要确认连按，按了1次右键蓄力，其实没有按成；还有戳棍中的搅棍，用着极其难受，干脆放弃了戳棍。  -锁定功能，纯纯答辩，可能还不完善。黑猴是软锁，遇到速度BOSS会出现视角跟不上BOSS从而看不清或者晚看到出招，大型BOSS会被挡视野，部分BOSS还有丢锁定的机制，下一秒跳到你看不到的地方放冷箭，初见大多数都会被恶心到，如果用手柄玩又是必锁的，不锁玩一会大拇指极其难受。喷归喷，游科有一点是要夸的，黑猴大型BOSS很多，而大型BOSS想做好很难，这种魄力值得尊敬。  -敌人多数韧性高，吗喽纯纯的低韧性飞舞，蓄力重棍容易被打断，本身硬直也大。还有就是GP收益太低了，面对灵活BOSS还会出现打不到的情况，作为动作游戏里收益最高最有成就感的系统（防止抬杠，黑猴应该是ARPG）很多时候在使出GP后以为进入自己的回合可以输出了，BOSS直接反击一套打过来，挫败感严重。  -完美闪避，完美定身法收益一般，特别是完美闪避，后期大量的BOSS有疯狗一样的攻击欲望，欲望低的要么就有大范围冲击波，这时候完美闪避加的那点减伤太抠门了，很多时候都不愿意用完美闪避，干脆直接跑。  -击中反馈不错，但受击反馈奇差无比，有时候被打到了是不知道的，需要看左下角的血条，这点被火焰，毒气，寒冰碰到上后极其明显，遇到特效强，演出夸张的BOSS，不看血条基本没感觉到掉血。  -没有真正意义的远程手段，喜欢第二章的弓箭手吗？喜欢到处乱飞的BOSS吗？遇到这些吗喽就是纯纯的小丑，给一点远程神通可以吧？  -动作系统深度不够，黑猴的主要战斗核心在于棍势槽，轻攻击重复，完全可以三种棍势做出三套轻攻击，棍势转换也是可以大做文章的，法术辅助给游戏带来的延展性有限，流程太长，到了后期战斗单调。只狼也攻击重复但是妙在战斗交互上，见招拆招。仁王有一套独立且顶级的战斗系统，能支撑玩家上百小时的钻研。这一点不是批评，动作系统想做好非常困难，对于没有经验的厂商来说，不能要求他动作系统能跟上一流水准。   3。BOSS战设计： 先叠甲，对BOSS战的评价极其主观，比如很多人说青背龙，亢金龙粪，我一次就过了，根本没来得及看他哪里粪，小黄龙，寅虎，幽魂这种贴吧，论坛都觉得难的，我几次过了，没感觉难。同理，王灵官这个出生我打了挺久，我对他了如指掌，这货就是构思设计，而一次过的玩家会觉得还好。  +BOSS形象刻画优秀，部分BOSS设计出色，有业界一流水准，如大圣残躯，虎先锋，小黄龙。 +BOSS数量众多，隐藏BOSS，支线BOSS的奖励丰富，促进玩家挑战性。 +BOSS演出无敌，夜叉王，黄眉，大圣残躯等都极具史诗感。  -出生百目魔君，就这一个比得上整个黄金树幽影里的BOSS，两腿之间有空气墙，气愤之处在于不是自身失误，而且系统设计上，这种负反馈一个能顶十个，单单一个我就要拉出来骂。  -部分BOSS技能动画“硬控”大圣残躯设计得很好，但是有一个抢酒的动画，为了体现大圣的形象作这个动画没问题，但为什么不能跳过？动画长达20多秒，你干脆把手柄抢走20多秒再还给我得了，还有黄眉第三阶段抓取动画太长且不能跳过，本人极度不喜欢这种设计。  -BOSS战同质化严重，越到后期越明显，四足BOSS，大部分打一套必撤步，绕后必后踢，时不时大范围冲击。同时本作充斥着大量0帧出手,快慢刀,逆天投技，多段攻击判定的BOSS。该点不算缺点，游科敢做这么多BOSS就是有魄力，有能力，但我很多打得不爽。  -有点重视BOSS演出，轻视交互。喜欢魔将妙音，晦月魔君，石青蛙，王灵官这些BOSS吗？不是让你跑马拉松就是刮痧，亦或是天上乱飞让你肏不到他。粪怪跟好怪的区别就在于玩家被粪怪打死是觉得机制答辩（魔将妙音），被好怪击败后是感觉自己菜（比如虎先锋）王灵官，魔将妙音，百目魔君可以竞争黑吗喽最佳BOSS。  4.剧情 如果本作剧情是在《西游记》之后的改编，我给0分。如果是按照《悟空传》《斗战神》的改编，那无所谓了。 序章直接啪啪打我脸，这演出和台词也太次了，“蠢狗，退下”“这里除了我，没人配与他单挑”“若是我输了，他们照样铲平花果山”这台词有一股混混约架的味道，有种上小学看玄幻文的中二感。4年前首支预告里大闹天宫片段让我极其兴奋，而打完序章演出有一种落差感。有人要说，这也能喷？只能说如果是以普通玩家的方式进入游戏的话，那黑神话悟空没有任何问题，甚至超出预期。但如果是从2020年8月20日看到预告开始就开始兴奋，对于期待值拉满的玩家来说，剧情没有达到及格这个级别。   以下让我想打低分的因素，评测说完了，正常玩家可不看。 十分制前面我说了给八分，按理来说是好评和4颗星，差评是本人原因 1.发售前直接贷款年度，这种现象最早可以追溯到去年，理性说几句又被说跪久了站不起来。  2.我就说了一句黑猴这个土地庙和仁王的神龛很像，并且精魄就是仁王的妖怪技，结果直接被骂到开除国籍，说文化不自信导致的，我错就错在不应该说黑神话不好，猴警猿批强。  3。IGN评分出来后直接复制粘贴去战神评论区刷差评，这种行为极度败坏路人缘，现在大顺风了依然有刷差评的，喜欢黑神话可以，有必要用这种方式去踩其他游戏？  4.有人不在乎老外评价，但用英文评论给黑神话刷好评，不是兄弟，有必要吗？还有装日本人用日文发好评的国人，人人讨厌伏拉夫，又希望有更多的伏拉夫。  5.碰瓷年度游戏，战神区躺枪，老头环只狼躺枪，MC能上90分的游戏需要很多媒体去打高分，黑猴PC目前81分还是很稳定的，没上90是不是不会欣赏呢？仁王1PC版暴力移植，本身缺点也多PC版84分，只狼PC版88分，忍龙2XBOX360版也是81分（无PC版），黑猴81分很低吗？难道是想表达比忍龙2高出一个档次？黑猴吧之前还有人发帖说什么四周目黑猴，体验完爆艾尔登法环，一千多条回复，10个人居然有8个人赞同这个观点，吧主牢洛都站出来发声说别恶意拉踩其他游戏。  6.对自己不利言论的马上说是反串，水军，跟风黑，黑猴游玩时长比他少就说才玩几个小时就评论上了？玩得多，怎么全成就都没有？彩笔一个。以上两种不符合触发第三条，玩过几个游戏啊你bb啥？如果第三条不满足，就会触发第四条50W标签，总之跟猿批对线必败。我的评价是义务教育跟不上互联网普及率导致的。  7.上一点的补充，评分只做参考，一款游戏通关后它在你内心的分数跟你的游戏经历有关，比如FS社的忍者之刃本身很烂，但它像忍龙，所以我愿意给他70分，而在MC评分里，它是一坨61分的纯工业垃圾。国内外都有不合理的媒体，没有绝对客观，国内游民星空给了黑猴10分，游民星空也是勾史，10分的死亡搁浅，8.7分的2042，还有最经典的毁灭战士4给6.5分，这媒体的可信度能跟IGN本部一较高下。A9VG还算是可以的，A9黑猴给9分，黄金树幽影给8.5分。  8.一些宗教狂热分子，嘴上文化自信，但各种视奸库存，随机开除国籍，一句不好，人家就反驳你为什么见不得中国游戏好？游戏厂商也是企业，游戏是商品，企业是以盈利为目的，消费者有权评论。不讨厌游戏，我只讨厌傻逼无脑粉，一说缺点就是在故意抹黑，破坏气场，人总是喜欢听好话。",3964.0,2024-08-30 01:55:06,Not Recommended

0.6384986639022827,english,"Black Myth Wukong gives you everything you need from a modern day video game.     9/10 Graphics - The graphics are superb. There are certain areas in the game that really stand out, especially as you get towards the end game. You can see the effort put into the small details that really are meant to bring the word together in a fantastical way.     9/10 Design - The character designs are top notch. They really drive home the lore of the monkey king and utilize everything in their arsenal to bring the story to life. There are moments where it is dark and gritty and there are moments where it is bright and loud. You appreciate all of it    9/10 Story - How can you not enjoy the story of the journey to the west? The developers game science really did a exceptional job with teling the story while also providing engaging and challenging combat. The charatcers in-game all make you feel the story of the world is alive and the best part is the in-game anime/motion scenes that play inbetween chapters to really finalize what you experienced in the play before. They are not cheaply made either. Some of them i wish were full blown series. Fantastic job    8/10 Replayability - The game has an insane amount of hidden content and they offer all of this to you for one single price and no forced DLC purchases. There is alot of hidden bosses to find and little areas to explore. It is not quite open world, but it sure makes you feel that it somewhat is. The level design is top notch and allows for multiple playthroughs to explore every bit of it plus the skill trees and builds you can acquire to alter your playstyle are amazing as well.     9/10 Combat - The combat is incredible, fluid and VERY rewarding. Every hit feels powerful, has good sound to it and offers unique playstyles to keep you engaged.     10/10 Value - Black Myth Wukong offers UNBEATABLE value. The game is a one time purchase with no DLC and offers a massive amount of content to engage with. This is how games shoudl be made and offered with no microtransaction in sight at the time of this review.     Overall I would give this game a solid 9/10 for a score. It is well worth your money and i highly suggest you check it out especially if its on sale.",2233.0,2024-11-21 05:27:53,Recommended
0.6343313455581665,english,"[i]""This game taught me to git gud.""[/i]  [h1][i]As a fan of JTTW, you certainly don't wanna miss [b]Black Myth: Wukong[/b]! That is if you're also into action games, while it can be difficult for some but it's definitely worth playing.[/i][/h1]  [i]Not trying to be bias here, but the game's a blessing in a way for most of us, as JTTW fans. To be fair I've not watched the OG 1986 Journey to the West, only 96' TVB version and some other films.. it may not be the greatest adaptation, however I did enjoy the show as a kid. Been waiting for the game since the first trailer around 4 years ago, it did not disappoint.[/i]  Timeline is set after JTTW, basically like a sequel, the story seemed to be very well-thought-out. A masterpiece, I'd say. The lore and backstory may be confusing for players who aren't familiar with JTTW though, some are explained in the ""Journal"", they're long but pretty interesting read. It's not perfect still, due to some flaws such as some minor lighting bugs, camera angles on certain fights and invisible walls in most areas. Game design is alright, there is no map nor indicator so it may be an issue for anyone with [i]fish[/i] memory and/or just couldn't travel around the place much due to time constraint. The objectives/side quests doesn't show anywhere so players need to observe and listen to what the NPCs' are saying which may indicate something along the story as well. Just don't go diving into the game expecting it to be like some sort of chill RPG, or wise you'd be greatly disappointed. You don't get to beat small baddies much, because you'll run into bosses as you progress the story. Game completion time varies, main story can be completed in less than 50 hours, it would definitely go higher if you'd also do other objectives. Do note that some quests/objectives are highly missable in the run. Game visual looks absolutely stunning, the animations and arts are very impressive too. Soundtracks are great, especially the final boss part. Combat is pretty decent, great variety of abilities to choose from. Often times activating abilities and healing feels like there's a delay to it though, perhaps that's just how it's intended to be in the game. Difficulty-wise it starts off souls-like kinda style, but as the player progress on upgrading better stats after (presumably around Chapter 2-3) it will eventually feel more of a hack n' slash.. I find some of the bosses are tough to beat still. One thing to note is that Chapter 6 feels rather rushed, I got lost long enough trying to figure out where to go and what to do. Nevertheless I've beaten the game (aside from missing a few quests) at 110+- hours with [b]Spell Bind[/b] most of the time, occasionally with a few stat boost from medicine.

It's just mini-bosses with hardly any mobs between them, leaving most of the game play being boss fights that you die over and over to until you figure out their moves.   To make it worse, the fighting itself just doesn't feel good. For a game that is supposed to reward technical game play, you are locked out of dodging often with attack animations and jumps don't avoid AOE boss attacks, leading to boring run away and wait game play.",593.0,2024-11-14 13:49:25,Not Recommended

0.6078123450279235,english,"After waiting for this game since it's teaser trailer, and now finally completing the game (and most side quests), I am ready give my opinion on it.    Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game.    BMW is a difficult boss rush game with a fantastic story and minor RPG elements. Many people have already brought up the minor points of the game so I am gong straight to the main point. The combat is pretty much the whole of the game, going from boss to boss with minor fights in-between. The fights are incredibly punishing but feel so because the bosses are artificially difficult. I can only explain it through an example: After encountering a boss and dying multiple times you learn the bosses move sets and are able to dodge their moves and time your attacks. However, even after you do so, you realize that the boss still has 2/3rds of their health left and you have to battle perfectly...5 MORE TIMES.   It really becomes a test of endurance rather than skill or reflexes. This becomes even more apparent after you utilize all of your spells and skills and are now left to slog through the battle with two incredibly repetitive moves (light and heavy attack). I found myself fairly bored with many battles, despite still dying repeatedly, because the enemies just last way too long because of their artificially inflated health bars. I have never played dark souls so I cannot compare it to BMW. To compare it to other games it feels like any other action adventure game just played on the highest difficulty. And that's the biggest problem I have with this game: why would it have been so hard to put in a difficulty option and simply reduce or increase the bosses health for each level you choose?    The lack of difficulty options bothers me so much because it just makes me think of all of the people who gave up on this game, never even tried it, or just sped through it and missed so much side content and deep lore. Because that is where this game shines: the story is the reason I pushed through to the end. It is a ""sequel"", of sorts, to Journey to the West. The love the devs have of the source material is apparent in the beautifully crafted world, uniquely designed enemies and characters, and, most important, the masterfully told stories in the journal entries. Seriously, if you play this game: read the journal entries! They could be sold as a book on their own. If you really want to understand the story you must read the journal entries.    With so much love put into the story you would think they want people to experience it. Instead the artificially difficult bosses and slightly boring combat blocks many people from fully enjoying it or even being able to see it in the first place.    I understand this game is meant to be difficult but it still baffles me that the devs put so much into a story that so many people will not see or fully appreciate. It is because of this that I cannot recommend Black Myth: Wukong until a difficulty option is implemented (which will never happen). I'm sure most responses to this review will simply be: ""git gud""",3081.0,2024-11-11 14:51:29,Not Recommended

It is not as hard as it seems , only some bosses like Yellow Loong , Erlang where extremely difficult and other bosses were decent as its souls like , but not hard as ELDEN RING.  For those who haven't played this game:  1] Good story ...its kind of a boss rush game but still the story hold some weight .  2] Graphics are good .  3] It has parry (counter attack) but very very difficult to perform and u have to rely mostly on Dodge which is cool and when u perform a perfect dodge it feels great.  4] Some irritating enemies and cool boss . Not all bosses are introduced  like in Elden ring some are straight fordward and simple duel.  5] Gameplay lenght for beginner is 50 - 60 hr or can be more depends on your skill but its fun.  6] Same set of attacks feels boring until u master it and combine it with counter attacks.  7] Easy for "" Completionist Showcase "" to achive as u can get 90% for the achivements just by progressing through game  and items u need to grind like "" plant seeds "" .  8] Your can get 100% achivements after u complete the game 2nd time considering u have not miss any items and quests. In this game some items are missable and if u miss them u have to play whole game again like "" Auspicious Lantern curios "" etc. I had to play it 3rd time to get those item .  9] Once u complete game NG+ is easy....most of the boss fights are very very easy except for Erlang and final boss and some other.  10] Try this game.  its 10/10 for me.",1690.0,2024-11-28 02:43:17,Recommended

0.5633953809738159,english,"Wukong exceeded all of my expectations. From the very beginning, the intro is beyond epic. Celestial Court, Erlang. The Four Heavenly Kings.   Animations, transitions, and overall directing are of a very high quality.   It is an adventure game, much like God of War 2018 or Fallen Order. However, unlike those two, the levels are incredibly linear without any metroidvania elements, which is a big improvement in my eyes; there is almost no copy-paste and no back tracking.     [b]Gameplay:[/b]  The core itself is janky; hitboxes, responsiveness, getting locked into animations and timings aren't perfect. Even though difficulty is fixed, the game itself isn't very hard if you explore thoroughly and kill all of the bosses. Most of the bosses won't pose a challenge. Level design in acts 3, which is the weakest part of the game, and 6 is lacking. Also, invisible walls are annoying.   However, the variety of bosses and enemies is incredibly good. 100+ [b]unique[/b] bosses is a commendable achievement. Which is more than Elden Ring has, for example. Fighting in Wukong never felt repetitive to me, despite those flaws. Progression feels relevant for the most part, but closer to the middle you just dump it into stats. There are several abilities to choose from. Combat itself is decent; there are many skills to use, and they are mostly restricted by cooldown, which is a good thing. You use your whole arsenal, 5 abilities and 1 vessel, in every boss fight. It is not about spamming dodge/parry or one skill/attack. Many people praise the combat, but it's not the strongest part of the game.     [b]Story:[/b]  It is good if you didn't read the book. Zhu Baije, main villains and side characters are well written.   But after reading forums and two volumes of The Journey to the West, I could say the story gets even better. A lot of attention to detail. Black Myth: Wukong captures the spirit of the book and amplifies it through visuals. Which is a great achievement in itself.   Every chapter you get a great self-contained story. At the end of each chapter, there is a cartoon explaining the backstory of the characters participating. Those cartoons are very touching and beautiful. The soundtrack reinforces that feeling. Even without understanding the backstory, a lot of cutscenes and interactions are very epic and gorgeous looking. For some people it might be hard to follow at times; it tries to tell a lot of things without over-explaining.     Definitely a must-play for those who like the adventure genre or read TJTTW.

Whether it’s the smooth combat experience, rich combat techniques, magical artifacts, diverse bosses, or the exquisite graphics and delightful music—everything is truly remarkable. ""Black Myth: Wukong"" is undoubtedly one of the best games currently available!   [h1] Combat Experience: 8.8/10 [/h1] In ""Black Myth: Wukong,"" players can switch between three different staff techniques at any time during combat. Each technique is suitable for dealing with various types of minor enemies, bosses, and larger foes. Additionally, there are multiple skills available, such as ""Stun Technique,"" ""Invisibility,"" and ""Boss Transformation,"" along with specific weapons designed to counter particularly challenging enemies.  However, a minor drawback is that the game lacks pre-input commands, making the ""Counter"" mechanism dependent on the player's memory of boss attacks, quick judgment, and timing during strikes. This can make it difficult to trigger the ""Counter,"" and dodging may sometimes feel sluggish. Fortunately, this issue can be mitigated by replacing the staff with a spear.

0.6224800944328308,english,"This is not the traditional type of game that I play.  I usually like turn-based games like X-Com.  As I have gotten older (I'm now 61 years old), I have avoided FPS and any games that relies on fast accurate reflexes and reaction times.  I am just terrible at those types of games.    However, I am also an ABC (American Born Chinese) and was intrigued by the rave reviews that Black Myth: Wukong was getting.  I am not familiar with the ""Journey to the West"" stories either and I thought it would be cool to play this game to learn a little bit of my heritage.    Okay, long story short:  I am having a ton of fun playing this game.  Right now, I'm at about 37 hours and I am at the beginnings of Chapter 2 so I'm taking a long leisurely time playing it (also because this is not the typical type of game that I play so I'm not good at it compared to a lot of other people).    To my surprise, I have been successful at beating more bosses and getting further into the game than I thought possible.  I sort of expected to be stuck at the first boss and eventually quit in frustration.    However, the game seems to allow the user to eventually be able to beat any boss by allowing us to gain experience (to gain skills) and freely rearrange our skills so that we eventually get to the point where we can beat a boss.  At least, that's my hope.    And it's really satisfying when you do beat a boss.   I have encountered 2 or 3 bosses where it took me awhile to either figure out how (or be lucky enough or gain enough skills) to eventually beat them.  If you encounter a boss you can't beat, you can just go around beating lesser opponents until you can level up and gain a skill that might help.  And I have encountered some bosses where I was able to beat them on the first try.    I am fearful that I will eventually encounter a boss that I can't beat and quit the game.  I hope that with patience, I will be able to beat all the bosses I encounter and be able to finish the game.  I really hope that I can finish the game.    The game is very polish and beautiful.  It even plays and looks great on lesser hardware (I'm playing with an Intel Arc A380).   I'm having a lot of fun and I find the story to be interesting (although a lot of times I don't really know what is going on since I am not familiar with the source material).  It has given me interest in learning more about the source material it is based on.  I'll probably end up watching some of those Journey to the West movies with Stephen Chow (I did see one awhile ago and I remember that I thought it was very funny and entertaining but I will probably enjoy it more now as I slowly learn more about the Monkey King myth)    Overall, I do highly recommend this game.",2736.0,2024-10-08 12:31:34,Recommended

0.6025310754776,english,"I just finished the game and it's a solid 9/10! I had a great experience!  I never thought I would enjoy what seemed to be like a souls-like combatwise, but the game was much more than that. Rather than the sluggish, slow pace of souls-likes, Wukong is fast-paced, dynamic and fun from the go. As you advance, you get more tools in the form of spells, transformations, items, etc. to tackle the hardest of opponents. The gameplay is an immense joy from start to finish.  I had some issues following the story, as I know next to nothing about the legend of Sun Wukong. The game is an imagined sequal to Sun Wukongs legacy, so I would say knowing about it beforehand will elevate the story for you. That being said, the chapter stories are well told and executed and carried some emotional weight as well.   World and feeling is amazing. The game looks beautiful and it ran well on my four year old rig. I had to tune some settings, but the game ran at 80-100+ fps at all times - and looked stunning, even with some settings turned way down. A downside about the game world is first of all a lack of a map - there are so many areas, secret ones included (I managed to finish them all with A LOT of backtracking). The areas have lots of invisible walls and it's not always clear where you are ""allowed"" to go or not. Other games border the play area a lot better and more clearly.   The game (side content included) was just shy of 50 hours, which is absolutely worth the money imo. I've yet to go New Game+, but I know that it has more (new) items, spells, etc. and could be a fun romp.   I highly recommend this game :-)    ",1623.0,2024-10-19 19:26:13,Recommended

What stood out to me the most were the boss battles. There are so many of them, and each one feels different and challenging in its own way. The variety of enemies is insane too. Just imagine: every creature has its own touching backstory in the game's bestiary!  You can definitely tell the developers were inspired by games like Dark Souls with the intense, thoughtful combat, and God of War for the sheer scale and epic feel of the action. But at the same time, Black Myth: Wukong feels totally fresh and unique because of its Chinese mythology and visual style. That blend of familiar and new kept me hooked the whole way through.   The only thing that felt far from perfect to me was the presence of incredibly large, empty areas in the third part of the game. They invite exploration, but there’s no reward for doing so, which is really disappointing for a detail-oriented player like me.  Last - but not the least - are six cartoons between each part of the game. Wow. They’re stunning - like mini-movies that not only look amazing but add so much to the story.

Although the movesets are repetitive, the action remains delightful throughout the whole campaign. The multitude of transformations also help to keep the gameplay appealing.  Performance issues are present but don’t ruin the fun. Even when playing on the most recent hardware, occasional stuttering occurs.  Visually, this game is nothing short of stunning. I found myself stopping more than a few times because the world is so beautifully crafted. Characters are engaging, and the story, inspired by Journey to the West, draws you in.  The biggest immersion breaker are the invisible walls scattered throughout the game. What makes it frustrating is the inconsistency: you can’t always predict where they’ll be, so you’re forced to test boundaries constantly.  The voice acting is top-notch. From the sound effects of every weapon clash to the soundtrack, there's nothing to complain about the audio department. It’s so immersive and high quality.  One of the game's standout features is its impressive roster of over 100 bosses. Each one unique and hand crafted. While most bosses are tough but fair, there are around five or six that stand out as especially brutal, echoing the signature of the genre.  One last significant downside of the game is the input buffering. In high-pressure moments when precision matters most, the game can miss your inputs, leading to frustration.  Despite some few issues, Wukong’s beautiful visuals, satisfying combat, and engaging characters make it a game well worth playing.

I also want to add that the combat and the bosses are great, although it is a bit repetitive, which is what I find this game to suffer from the most.  BM Wukong is way too long for it's own good, there is not enough variety for this to be a 40-60 hour long game and It overstayed it's welcome in some of the chapters, which brings me to the next issue:  The inconsistency of this game's quality is obvious in many occasions, for example, I loved the first 2 chapters, but the 3rd went a bit downhill because it was wayyyy too long, the 4th chapter was pretty dogshit and at that point I was losing interest in the game, fortunately the 5th chapter was great and didn't overstay it's welcome, but it loses all of it's momentum again with the 6th, which was, also ass.

0.5634920597076416,english,"[h1] Introduction [/h1] Think need to start from an information - I’ve been waited for this game for a long time, pre-ordered it and finished it in just a few days. Black Myth Wukong (later Wukong) really impressed me, while before the great release I was really worried that game may be not such good as developers presented it. I was worried about Unreal Engine 5 (later UE5), as not so many developers showed well opportunities about this Engine, and usually players had problem with optimization. The same questions were about gameplay and plot. So as you may understand - before the release there were much more questions then answers.  [h1] Plot [/h1] The story pleasantly surprised me, the game literally captivates you from the very first minutes and makes you spend as much time as possible in it, wanting to see the ending. After each chapter, there are animated inserts that complement the plot and this is very cool. In each chapter, the story slowly unfolds for you, you meet characters from a past life of main character, some of them helps you, others hinder you. I had a great immersion and that's why I finished the game in the first 7 days.  [h1] Viasuals [/h1] The visual style is so excellent that with every second you can lose the line between the game and reality. I would like to compare this game with Hellblade 2 (may be later I will make a review about it as well), which also had excellent visuals. The only thing is that when Hellblade feels huge, where they cut off a bunch of locations for you, but the world feels empty at the same time. With Wukong, everything is different - the world feels full, every turn looks different, and there is a feeling that there is even a little more content here than I wanted. At the same time, it seems to me - this game has the best optimization on UE5, my game was going great from the very first day and you know what? Personally for me - Wukong is best optimized game at release day, and I think even it’s the best UE5 game.  [h1] Dark Souls vs Black Myth [/h1] Everyone positioned this game with Souls. I thought so too at the very beginning, the game is not the easiest and you understand really fast that you will have a hard times. But then everyone started comparing it to God of War. I will say - Wukong is non of them. Although the game is difficult, it does not spare you, but difficult - in fact difficult bosses can be counted on the fingers. And every time you can't pass the boss - just go back, find an additional turn and explore another location - you definitely find few things that will help you to improve your weapons or armor. So often - if you think you are not able to pass someone, actually you can if you explore a little more of the location. Is this similar to Souls? In my understanding, not quite, but it also does not look much like God of War.  [h1] Conclusion [/h1] Wukong gave me quite more than 40 hours of great gameplay. I enjoyed the game immensely, and considering that - 2024 was not so saturated with games, Wukong is basically the best thing that came out this year. Both in terms of visuals, optimization, and in terms of gameplay. Although the game does not have any outstanding or to great plot, but it is not that horror plot which was in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/n-flanders/recommended/412020/]Metro[/url] or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/n-flanders/recommended/750920/]Tomb Raider[/url]. The game is not Souls, but not God of War either, it gives something else, between these games, combining both gameplays and creating something of its own. This is not an ordinary copy-paste, and playing this game you can understand that you are playing Wukong. The game that gives you huge and rich locations, pleasant and warm emotions and the opportunity to immerse yourself in a magnificent world where one monkey can change the world.",3859.0,2024-12-01 20:48:07,Recommended
0.552603006362915,english,"This game is okay. I would normally recommend it, but I'm giving a not recommended because I think it's too highly rated for what it is. I would give it a middle review if I could.  It is visually stunning, the areas look magnificent to say the least. The cutscenes and boss intros are fantastic. But the problems come when you are actually playing the game.  Exploration is abysmal. The first act's map is okay, lots of invisible walls arbitrarily blocking you, but not too many winding paths. Not really anything interesting either, though. The second act, however, is a mess. The map intersects with itself everywhere, you can run around in circles for a while and still miss things because they're placed in awkward spots constantly. There is no ""flow"" to exploring the map; items, bosses, and enemies feel arbitrarily plopped down where they are almost always. Can't speak for anything past there, because that's where I dropped the game, but I've heard it's much the same if not worse going forward.  Then we have the combat. This game's combat is okay. It's not good, definitely the worst of any Soulslike game I've ever played, also definitely worse than God of War's (which I see it compared to frequently, though I don't really see it. More of a Souls game). There are two main functions, hit and dodge. That's it. You can learn some other techniques throughout the game that give it ever so slightly more depth, but you will spend most of your time in every boss fight spamming dodge and attack. The bosses don't have interesting interactions with different abilities like FromSoft titles (because there are no interesting abilities), they don't have certain moves you can parry (because there is no parry), they don't really do anything except swing at you with a different cadence than the last enemy you fought.  Combined with possibly one of the most forgiving dodges of any game ever, this leads to a game that is painfully easy and one-dimensional, in a genre that typically relies heavily on the difficulty and intricacy of its combat to remain engaging. You don't get that addictive sensation of learning or improving while playing. Up to and including the tiger boss in act 2, I think there were 2 enemies that took me more than 5 attempts to defeat. Most bosses I dropped on my literal first attempt, with zero knowledge of their moveset at all. It's a shame, because they have some great introductions, only to be complete pushovers.  The skill tree also feels unnecessarily bloated. It works on a similar gain XP > redeem a skill system as God of War or Sekiro, but unlike those games, most of these upgrades just feel... boring. Like they're only there to give you something to work towards and nothing else. A little more health, a little more stamina, blocking a few more abilities with a certain move, etc.  Despite how much I've been slogging on it, I still think it's a decent game. Just one of if not the weakest among its competition. If you are simply starving for third-person combat games, especially Soulslike titles, it's still worth trying out. Particularly if the difficulty of FromSoft game are usually daunting to you, though I don't know why you would even be looking at the genre if so. Maybe wait for a big sale.   6.5/10",3264.0,2024-12-19 06:23:43,Not Recommended

As I said the level design is great and I want to explore every corner of it, so it really breaks the immersion when I want to go in one direction only to be stopped by an unforeseen barrier.  2.

0.8414698243141174,english,"First, to get it out of the way, this game is great. I love it. It's a lot of fun, the story is engaging and memorable, it is *mostly* very polished. I've played through completely several times, and got 100% of the achievements.  That being said, the FLAWS in the game are very irritating a best, and stroke-risk levels of infuriating at worst. Starting with minor gripes and ""feedback"".  Most of the crafting materials are able to be purchased after a certain point. There are a couple of materials, however, that MUST be farmed, at least one of which has a terrible drop rate and amount, only drop from ONE enemy type, and those enemies are not only very few, but they aren't really set up along a ""farming route"". I'm talking about the withered silk-worm. Luckily, you only need it for two medicines, and they aren't super important, but it IS irritating. You only get them from these annoying stone worm things that basically knock you off of your feet, and take a few hits to kill, even with top tier, end game gear. Either making the enemies drop more of the item, make them drop from more enemies, arrange the enemies along a route that is efficient, or MAKE ALL CRAFTING ITEMS PURCHASABLE ONCE YOU BEAT THE GAME AND CONTINUE BEFORE BEGINNING A NEW CYCLE.  Respect the player's time, please. Doing things like this may pad out ""play time"" in some way, but these are the types of things that irk me and a lot of other players.  In the same vein, end game crafting materials should be abundant by the end of the second or third play through. I shouldn't have to play through the game 5 times to fully upgrade all of my weapons and armor because one or two crafting materials are only available in specific, limited amounts per play-through. During the first run, that makes sense, but by the end of the second or third, it's ridiculous.   This is highlighted by the fact that beyond a certain point, there's nothing you can really do with the excess of ""will"" (the in-game currency) that you do NOT drop upon death (like in souls games) and have hundreds of thousands of in the end. And while we're at it, it's really dumb that you can't sell UNNEEDED crafting materials that don't ""convert to will"" on additional play-throughs (which only seems to happen with key items). My inventory is cluttered with BS I can't do anything except watch the stack number raise.  Another minor gripe is the fact that there are unskippable cut scenes, either fully rendered or scripted ""in-engine"" scenes, even in NG+ and beyond. I understand making certain things unskippable during NG, because you want the story to be experienced, but I should have the option to skip ALL cut-scenes from NG+ and beyond. Again, PLEASE RESPECT THE PLAYER'S TIME. I am an adult. I love playing video games. I only have so much time to play them though, and having to sit through repeated, unchanged iterations of the same scenes over again takes away from my enjoyment.  The last *minor* gripe is that for some reason, probably the fault of the localization process (maybe?), certain mechanics are poorly explained and unclear. I shouldn't have to google what ""seeing through and enemy"" means in practice when it's a fairly core mechanic of the game. Or what exactly ""might"" and ""qi"" are while playing. And that's aside from the fact that there's no direct way to aquire them, even being impossible without certain items in your build.  More aggravating gripes:  While the game plays well most of the time, and this may be more of an engine problem, but the game seems to suffer from the EXTREMELY common trend of being under-optimized and assuming that anyone playing the game will have a machine new/powerful enough to compensate for heaving processing. While I NOW have good machines, I didn't always, so I can readily put myself in the shoes of someone with an older PC that wants to enjoy this game, but has to suffer through sudden frame rate drops. While I mostly play games on my desktop PC, I have been traveling with my laptop and playing on it. With a great processor and a 2070 super, I have to use throttlestop and MSI afterburner to overclock things enough to get the game to play decently, using TPFancontrol to lock fan speeds at max in order to keep things cool enough to not thermal throttle. And even then, for some reason, the dialed back settings seem to be overridden in the pause menu, dropping the frame rate from 60 to 8 and often crashing the game, if not my driver. I know most people aren't going to OC their machine, but hasn't been a problem with other games like Lies of P, Elden Ring, RE Village, etc.  Next, I don't know about anyone else, but I HATE runbacks to bosses in general. This game mostly doesn't have them, but the few that do exist are OBNOXIOUS. The battle with Giant Shigandang is a good example of this.  And speaking of Giant Shigandang... The auto-target system NEEDS WORK. Really, the camera placement needs work. When fighting this GIANT boss, you really need to stay in one area to avoid one-shot kill attacks, while also being close enough to run in and attack when you have the opportunity. For whatever reason, even with auto-target and all associated settings turned off, in that specific area, as the boss moves around, auto-target STILL automatically kicks in but switching, losing, and targeting different parts of the boss, whipping the camera around and often away from where you need to be looking. That also brings up how often the entire screen gets obstructed by the enemy you're fighting, often resulting in taking an outsized amount of damage. This wouldn't be a HUGE problem, except....  If you're going to have a game that is based around dodging with no blocking or parrying mechanic outside of optional skills, you'd better make the timing on those skills AND dodging VERY CONSISTENT. It simply isn't here. The ""seeing through"" mechanic, for example, requires timing based on where THE ANIMATION is in the middle of a combo, relative to the enemy's attack animation, which is also affected by frame drops. A delayed parry can be fine, like the special parry skill with the sword in Lies of P, but it is consistent and there is an alternative parry/block with that weapon. The timing here is worse than the parry mechanic in Code Vein, which was so bad I just never tried to parry since the parry was delayed, varied in its effective window, and just sucked. However, the other two games had practice dummies, with Lies of P even having one that attacked with consistent timing so you could practice parrying and get used to the timing without needing to go through loading screens to respawn enemies for practice.  Now for the MAJOR gripes:  This goes for MANY games, most of which I love, even though I hate these things:  INPUT READING, ROLL CATCHING, AND UNBLOCKABLE/UNDODGEABLE ANIMATION TRIGGERING ATTACKS ARE NOT A GOOD WAY OF INCREASING DIFFICULTY FOR BOSSES! IT IS JUST LAZY AND INFURIATING.  Make the boss faster, more responsive and punishing for button mashing or mistimed healing or dodges, but input reading especially is just infuriating. With the loong dragon in the webbed hollow, you can have the boss entirely stunlocked by your gang of monkey doubles while you charge your heavy attack, and the boss will block your attack every time. This is clear input reading. And don't get me started with the first ""final boss"" monkey in his final stage. I can be in cloud step, yet get parried EVERY SINGLE TIME if I use a heavy attack. INPUT READING IS LAZY.  As for roll catching, the Yin Tiger fight is the worst about this that I can' think of right now. He also pulls the unavoidable, animation triggering brutal attack, but not as bad as Non-Able. All of those things suck, and feel unfair during the fight, like they're just cheating. All of these ""difficulty measures"" do.  In general, the game is great, but it's not perfect, and all of these things make the balance feel off and could be improved upon.",7967.0,2025-06-20 22:16:59,Recommended

0.7354928255081176,english,"Now, this game is gorgeous and there is plenty of Chinese folklore that the devs have put obvious amounts of effort and love into making, and I'm not going to push against it for any of that, but I can't help but feel like the actual gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. Not that the bosses are a pushover or are bad in any way, far from it, but it feels so much like you are bound to a basic striking combo to build up a single big bonk, and very rarely does the game need you to use anything else.  Most of your variety in this game comes from spells. You will find little actually adds to your basic flow of combat besides unlocking things like a running attack to make the dodge-> attack flow fele more responsive. Those spells are, unfortunately, on quite a limited resource without many ways to earn it back besides resting at your usual bonfire/shrine/soulslike doohickey. Those spells ARE fun, and can be broken as all hell; freezing your opponent to get some hits in, or having the equivalent of a parry, or summoning five more of yourself and destroying a boss are all fun things to do. And then you use collectively maybe 4 spells and are out. You are back to using a single attack string and bonking things with your special attack sometimes.  It's also sad that, despite the name, you only play as Wukong for the very start of the game, the tutorial. Afterwards, you play as a nameless 'Destined One' who does not speak and does not have the personality and sass of Wukong. I feel like I'm walking in a world that would have been almost perfect to wander through if I was the Monkey King and had some funkier tricks up my sleeve, or at least if the Destined One has some semblance of character and followed in his footsteps. Rather, I feel like an unrelated monkey with a staff, talking to and beating up a bunch of important things.  And I have to re-iterate, this game is beautiful. The locales had so much time put into them, hair and fur shimmer in the light and bend in the wind, and each enemy is uniquely designed. It's just a shame that I couldn't care less for who fights them and the ways in which you fight them.  I would also like to mention that you have technically 3 styles in this game, but they only change your special attack (and when you use your special attack after a basic attack). I found there to be only minor edge cases where the basic Smash style was outdone by the others, and even if I was swapping styles relatively frequently, the special attacks are primarily useful after you have already done a number of strings with your basic attacks to build up energy. I don't think the styles are distinct enough to help with the feeling of, I guess boredom with this combat system, even if I was incentivised to swap on the go.  It has Overwhelmingly Positive reviews, and I think it deserves plenty of praise, but I feel my personal experience with far more engaging combat systems and stories has made me reluctant to give it another positive rating. Hopefully this stands out among the sea of blue.",3039.0,2025-06-28 02:51:55,Not Recommended

0.8333378434181213,english,"As someone who didn't even know the game was coming out and was in the making for years, this was a pleasant surprise.  I am Chinese, so all of the story is very familiar, however, even if you didn't have a childhood of Wukong stories, lots of Animes and media today includes parts of the mythology, like Goku from dragon ball, abilities from Naruto and so on.  The story on its own is incredibly interesting, the game tells the narrative in a unique way through out the game and especially the special animations at the end of each chapter. So if you are a story / campaign type player, you are definitely not left out. Also, if you happen to be familiar with the actual story itself, you will understand lots of the characters and references quickly as you play.  On the gameplay side of things, it plays like a souls game, but with extra steps. Invincibility frames on the dodge, bosses having patterns to recognise and defend against, stamina on attacks and movement, bonfire type check points and healing potions. What differs is the in depth combat mechanics like ""see through"" or ""rock solid"" which are basically parries, along side with other spells to change the style of play. All of the options give each player the ability to form their own build and gameplan depending on what they like.  The graphics in this game are just fantastic, I have never seen anything like it. From the environment, to entities, to the exceptionally well made cut scenes, everything just looks perfect. Personally, I haven't had a single case of performance issues, but you can't just take it from me alone, all of my friends who play the game also do not recall having any problems with performance.  Lastly, I just want to talk about content. There are several chapters in the game, each with different lengths. The base game without any side quests seems like any other story game, not too long, not short. However, as you play, you start to see the enormous amount of endless secrets hidden within each chapter, some you find simply with luck. Each chapters secret content can give you a leg up on the final boss of the chapter. Chapter 1 simply gives you a separate boss arena and an additional boss, however compared to chapter 4, where you can stumble upon a whole another chapter within that chapter. All of these side quests leads up to more secret content in the final chapter, which ultimately will allow you to achieve the secret ending.  Great game.",2452.0,2025-03-03 03:45:03,Recommended
0.8140589594841003,english,"Black Myth: Wukong is a strong first game for the developer, showing that it's more than just a impressive technical demo. When it was first revealed many doubted it would ever be a full game, but now we have a complete experience with solid gameplay and impressive technical execution.  The combat is smooth and offers a good variety of skills and combos, letting you develop your own playstyle. However, after a while the battles start to feel repetitive. By the time I reached the middle chapters I found myself wanting to push through just to see how the story unfolds.  The story follows the classic Journey to the West tale, which is interesting, especially for players who are not familiar with Chinese mythology. The scenes between chapters are beautifully animated and elevates the story with incredible music. While the game has some elements of soulslike, it has enough of its own style to be a good game.  Overall, it's a great debut that shows the growing impact of Chinese developers in the gaming industry.

0.7594879269599915,english,"[h1] One of the best lores and action game out there[/h1] [hr][/hr] I realized I finished this game (with 100% all achievements) a while back but never actually spoke about it here. This game is by all means a solid action game from last year and as much as I like to say it, this game has become lot better with more updates after I finished the game. So some of the complaints I had about this game are now fixed with updates so I will try to give a bit more proper opinion of what I liked and disliked about this game.  Black Myth: Wukong is a AAA game from Game Science (their first AAA actually) which focuses on action and boss battles. It has taken inspirations from souls-like genre and has also managed to keep it less punishing than the soulsborne games. This game is by no means an easy game to fight through but amidst all that difficulty is where the real fun comes. Below are few of the key points I will talk about.  [h2]Graphics:[/h2] As far as graphics are concerned this is one of the best looking game out there (if not the best). The visuals, art style, animations and graphics have so much detail and that it borderline rivals realism. You can have one look at the game and can tell they poured years of sweat and tears just to make the game look impressive and it absolutely shattered in that area.  [h2]Combat:[/h2] The combat of the game is nice and really skill challenging. You can tryna mash your button through the game or learn proper way to fight and use the properties of the skills to your advantage. Back when I played it I had a bit of a difficult time understanding the usage of particular skills and how they are advantageous because of the way the game explained those skills. Like the skill ""Resolute counterflow"" if timed properly can negate the damage from the enemies and for the longest time I never used it as it was intended to be only because the situations or how I can use it were never clear. I feel like these were some key essentials the game should have explained to make it more fun and challenging. But that aside, the combat animations were very cool, not just from the monkey but from the enemies and bosses as well it was really well designed. I am not a huge fan of stamina system but not a dealbreaker in this game.  [h2]Soundtracks:[/h2] This game has a god tier soundtrack and definitely complements everything the game has to offer. Its very inspirational and makes you want to go all out in battles.  [h2]World and level design:[/h2] Many things about the game are changed since last I played it. One of my biggest issues with the game was that the levels were so huge and maze-like we definitely need a map to keep track of the places we already visited so that we do not get lost (this I believe is fixed with a map feature). Second is half the time I kept wondering what am I supposed to do in a level when I am there. Like I should have an objective marker to know what I am doing here as most of the time the cutscenes were not helping on what I am supposed to do (a separate point I will explain later). This is something I realized when I reached the ""Pagoda Realm"" when I had no idea what to do next, like the broader objective of getting relics I understand but what should be my immediate next objective. Also we take on lot of side missions which we may forget but should be good to keep a track of. Not sure if this is all fixed or its still there. Other than that the game's world design looked incredible and the way it looked definitely projected the intent of the location. The spider cave kept giving creepy vibes, the Huaguo mountains looked like a place where different animals thrived, the lava mountains looked like a fiery hostile environment and the Sandgate village looked desolate and deserted (to name a few). The level design was also done well. Except the one thing that I clearly noticed and bothered me is the lack of world boundary as half of the time I wasn't able to tell if a place looks like it can be explored or not. So a collision boundary was needed imo.  [h2]Plot and lore:[/h2] This by far is my favourite thing of this game. The game has an excellent plot attached, but its often very hard to realize as the game imo does a very poor job of narrating it throughout the game. Let me be clearer..... if you have more or less good understanding of the story of ""Journey to the West"", then the plot of this game and dialogues start to make incredibly sense to you. This game is basically a re-imagined sequel of the Journey to the West. While the story is absolutely incredible and made me delve deeper into this entire lore, the story in the game is placed in such a way that if you are new to the game and story, then most of the dialogues and things happening in the story won't click to you which I feel like such a waste as the plot is downright impressive. I do not want to attach any links here so if you want to know more about the lore and story (Chapter-wise) I would recommend checking the ""BanditGames"" channel, his videos are by far my favourite explanations of the lore of Wukong.   [h2]Bosses:[/h2] This brings me to my final point and my second favourite aspect of this game. I love games when they have challenging bosses (but also have to be fun), this game has a lot of them (a bit too much of them as a matter of fact). All the bosses have very good design, some looked intimidating while some are comical. The difficulty of some of the bosses were questionable but some had well balanced moves. Overall as a game where you have to keep fighting bosses one after the other, this game has done a more or less good job of maintaining balance between which bosses to be very difficult and which ones to be moderate.  This game (back when I played) had a lot of optimization issues, as a matter of fact it looked like the devs didn't care about PC optimization at all (I use a 4090 and still felt like this). This might be a by-product of making the incredibly realistic visuals or the inexperience of the devs in that department but for what its worth, its a bit more stable now.  All in all, this game mostly has some design related issues (which is basically mostly poor decision making from the devs themselves) but definitely in upper leagues in the fun factor. As the first AAA game from Game Science they absolutely nailed it. They can use the issues from this game to learn what to do better in their next game and they are gonna absolutely kill it. I seriously believed this game is gonna win the GOTY 2024 but its popular and profitable so that's a win too.  I highly recommend this game if you are action lover and give it a solid 8.9/10.",6665.0,2025-04-27 20:24:24,Recommended
0.7532552480697631,english,"Graphics and Sound The game looks absolutely beautiful. The visuals are top-notch, and the music and sound effects are just as impressive. Everything feels polished and high-quality in that department.  Content There’s a lot to do here. The game offers 6 fairly long chapters, each packed with secrets and unique bosses. It definitely gives you a good amount of content for the price.  Exploration Exploration is where things start to fall short. The world feels very limited—there are invisible walls everywhere, which makes it feel like you're being pushed down a single path instead of really discovering anything. There's not much rewarding to find either, except for some low-quality herbs and places to meditate. That said, each chapter does hide a big secret area, which is a nice surprise. But finding these areas isn’t always intuitive—you might miss them completely if playing blind without searching the internet.  Combat Combat is the weakest part of the game. There’s no button queuing, so if you press an attack button before your current animation finishes, the input gets ignored. This makes fights feel clunky and unresponsive.  Enemy attacks often have strong tracking, while your own attacks don’t. That means enemies can easily hit you, but if they move while you’re swinging, your attacks often miss. It makes combat feel more about luck than skill sometimes.  Fighting normal enemies isn’t very exciting either—just charging a heavy attack before a fight is usually enough to take them out before they even get a hit in.  Bosses Boss design is hit-or-miss. While they’re visually unique and creative, a lot of them are frustrating for the wrong reasons. Many main bosses have mechanics that feel cheap, like draining your stamina, messing with the camera, or blocking your vision. Instead of feeling like a fun challenge, these moments just come off as annoying.  Overall Thoughts The game isn’t bad, but it’s definitely overrated and overhyped. With better combat and exploration, it could’ve been something really special. I just expected more. 7/10",2073.0,2025-04-14 01:49:04,Recommended
